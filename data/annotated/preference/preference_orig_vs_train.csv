6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,22,721,"I'm a physician, epidemiologist, and mother to a four year old boy with allergies to milk, peanuts and egg.  My son's dairy allergy is severe, and he has had numerous life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk, which required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the Emergency Department.  Tests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse, but fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut; he put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild  reaction.  

I've traveled with my children and despite calling ahead, making requests, and reminding employees at the door, I've rarely had respect, let alone consistency, in any kind of peanut-free buffer zone or flight.  Several years ago Continental Airlines customer service headquarters informed me that they would serve peanuts on all flights as they were unable to guarantee a peanut free flight.  (So why not hand out weapons since they can't guarantee a weapon free flight either?)  

I've sat with my epi pen in hand on a filthy flight with visible peanut crumbs on the floor while a flight attendant insisted on offering peanuts to the passengers around me because ""it was their right.""  

Fortunately for me, my son's peanut allergy is not severe enough that it prohibits us from air travel.  Now that he is old enough to not put things in his mouth, and to protect himself, we are safer.   However, I know of many, many others in the allergy community, children and adults who simply can NOT fly.  

My son's dairy allergy is quite severe.  The world would be a much safer place for us if no one consumed milk near him.  If his skin touches anything that once touched milk, even if it was partially cleaned, he will get severe hives.  If he consumes even less than a drop, within seconds his lips, eyes and face will swell, he will be covered in hives, vomit, and be gasping for breath.  Without epinephrine he would probably die within minutes.  But milk is ubiquitous, and milk allergy relatively uncommon, so we must protect ourselves.  Peanut allergy is common, and it is a simple step to serve an alternative peanut based snacks for a short period of time.  So why is this a big problem?

The vast majority of potential reactions would be eliminated by simply avoiding snacks that have peanuts or peanut butter as an ingredient.  Peanut oil is known to contain very little of the actual peanut protein, and would be of little risk in an airborne environment.  

As a physician, I have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance.  I am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane.  In addition, most epi-pens come in two pack doses, each of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes.  Which in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS.

I've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive, and are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety.  I think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.  Of course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face.  But I am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.  This restriction is designed to protect people with allergies from the airlines callous disregard for cleanliness and for our safety, not from our fellow passengers.

My son wanted to also write a letter.

""Hi.  My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.  I am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.  If I eat a peanut I'll get sick. I ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.  It was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.  I would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.  Everybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.""

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,10,719,"I have been watching this discussion for a couple of days now, and want to weigh in on a few issues that have been raised by both supporters and opponents of a proposed peanut ban. 

First, I find that most of the discussion has been focusing on children with allergies, and related to that, good parenting. This is certainly understandable, given the increase in peanut allergies among children. But it neglects another perspective - namely, the adult allergy sufferer. 

I've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 (and I am now in my late 20s). By the age of 6, I knew how to take my medications myself. Since the EpiPen has come out, I've carried epinephrine with me. And I've always had various other medications - e.g. inhaler - on hand. I would never expect an airline to have such medications on hand, though I would expect them to have a first-aid kit.

Opponents of the ban suggest that allergy sufferers simply avoid flying. It might be possible when the sufferer is a child - perhaps it is possible for a family to drive to grandma's house for Christmas instead of taking a plane. This depends, of course, on where grandma lives - if she lives in California, and the family lives in Maine, there might be problems.

Adults, on the other hand, travel by air for a myriad of reasons. As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one. 

Towards the end of graduate school, I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them. For offices that were far away, I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city. I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air, but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication. I've had allergies since the age of 2, so I understand that sometimes, my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others. But when I take all necessary precautions and still, my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one, because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts, isn't that a little ridiculous? Is this really a fair result? I shudder to think what life will be like when I am a ""full-fledged"" working adult. Will I have to forgo promotions because I cannot travel on peanut-laden flights? It sounds dramatic, but it's not melodramatic. The only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights.","Welcome to Regulation Room, and thank you for your comment, sbell.

Firstly, I have traveled relatively frequently out of the USA. What I find very interesting is that on the various airlines I have used, none have applied the Baggage Charge on my return flights from the other countries back to the USA. Why is this so? 
It leaves me to believe that either the other countries airline offices are operating on their own and more efficiently and therefore find it unnecessary to charge for baggage or that there is something definitely Not Transparent. 
Furthermore, it is my opinion that if there is a ""Charge"" for something, in this case baggage, that it is a contract and that the baggage if not delivered with the owner and the time of arrival, then the contract has been broken and a refund is due the customer.

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,9,733,"I would like to add on to Javier's comment. It is true that the quality of delay information is not always within the airline's control. Often, when the FAA institutes the practice of ""metering"" due to weather or high volume, the airline really can't advise the customers of the reason for a delay. In fact, in order to retain the right to take off, the airlines are required to load the plane and sit on the tarmac while the FAA figures out how to route traffic. 

Furthermore, having listened to ground control/tower communications on United flights, it's clear that the controllers can give an estimated delay, but that delay is subject to change. Again, the airline's information is only as good as the FAA's information - and, well, the situation is fluid.

To that end, DOT's rule must consider that FAA's traffic management practices and procedures might necessarily inhibit airlines' ability to comply with such regulations.","Thanks for your comment, stopwithspoilers, and welcome to Regulation Room.

Perhaps instead of banning peanuts and peanut products outright. Airlines and the DOT can provide sufferers with HEPA airmasks which I assume will prevent individuals from inhaling peanut dust.

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,41,723,"I have a great deal of empathy for those who have, or are related to someone who has, severe peanut allergies. Clearly, their health is much more important that my desire to snack on peanuts for a few hours, and I doubt many people could debate that.
Having said that, how exactly would such a ban on peanuts be enforced? I was on a Southwest flight not long ago, where a mom demanded that peanuts not be served on her flight with her daughter. The flight attendants complied. Mind you, this was Southwest Airlines, which had the marketing tagline ""We Fly For Peanuts"" for years. Common sense dictates that if your daughter has a severe peanut allergy, YOU DON'T FLY SOUTHWEST. Even if the crew agrees to suspend peanut service for this flight, the last flight served peanuts. There are discarded peanut bags in the seat back pocket in front of your daughter. Peanut dust is on the seats, in the ventilation, and everywhere else. How will keeping peanuts off of THIS leg of the flight protect you or your child? And even if peanuts are not served on that leg, if there's still an allergic reaction, how does that affect the airline's liability, or the liability of other passengers who might have eaten peanuts in the gate area and boarded with peanut dust on their hands?
On the same flight I, and many friends of mine who also travel frequently, each had a bag of nuts in our carry-on. Forget for a moment that it would be impossible (if not unconstitutional) for flight crew to prevent people from eating their own snacks while flying. The mere fact that I had an open bag of nuts in my carry-on - even if I never took it out - could have been enough to trigger this girl's allergy. The slippery-slope potential here boggles the mind. (You had peanut butter on your bagel for breakfast this morning? Sorry, sir, you can't board this flight.)
You will never convince peanut allergy sufferers or their families that this should not be controlled, and I can see their point without agreeing with it. Consider this: I am violently allergic to dogs and cats, yet most mass-market airlines now allow pets to be stowed in the passenger compartment. I don't recall anyone ever asking me if my health would be compromised by allowing pet dander aboard. I don't protest, because I am responsible for controlling my own allergies, whether that means carrying a dust mask or an epi-pen aboard. If I choose to fly, I alone must be responsible for my own health. As much as allergens might affect me, other people have rights too; and to twist around a well-known saying, ""My rights end where your nose begins.""","Thank you for sharing your thoughtful perspective on the topic of peanut bans on flights.

Passengers may lack check cashing privileges away from their home airport, yet face unplanned and likely elevated expenses after being ""bumped.""

There are already so many things a driver is responsible for without adding anything else.  The EOBR would just be one more thing they would have to keep up with.  A paper log is easy you just mark it when you stop and again when you leave.  No electronics involved in doing that. I do not see how the EOBR will improve safety either.

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,23,667,"As a frequent traveler and the mom of a 23 year old with multiple food allergies, I understand how complicated this type of rule making can be.  The ""rights"" of the peanut allergy sufferer are in direct conflict with the ""rights"" of the passengers that want to eat peanuts.  For many years we avoided the conflict by traveling throughout the U.S. via motorhome.  This is not a reasonalbe option for everyone since it can be very time consuming vs. flying. 
Now that my son is older and interested in traveling to Europe, we can't reasonably get there via motorhome.  We choose our airlines carefully, carry multiple Epi-pens, pack his food from home, and I pray.
It's a very scary propostion being 35,000 feet in the air over the open ocean, knowing that each Epi-pen is effective for approximately 10-15 minutes.  My son tries to sleep most of the flight and fortunately has a much larger bladder than I do.  He gets a window seat and one of us acts as his buffer to the food cart.
This is a scary and risky proposition with a 23 year old who can quickly determine his own symptoms. It would be even scarier with a young child.
The problem with peanuts and tree nuts is that they are dry and flaky so can readily become airborne.  Their oils are sticky and stubborn so can endure through a vigorous scrub with soap and water.
My son is also allergic to milk and eggs. Nobody talks about banning them because they don't have the above mentioned properties of peanuts and tree nuts.
Traveling the world is an envigorating and enlightening experience that many would argue is as important as the structured education that we experience from 12-16+ years. Many people have to travel for work and others are required to relocate to keep their employment.
Back to the question of your rights or mine.  I prefer to live in an educated, enlightened, fulfilled, and respectful society. 
If my donut is going to set off your diabetes, I will gladly forgo the donut for six to twelve to twenty four hours.  I can live without it.
Everyone can live without peanuts and tree nuts.  So let's be reasonable and let all safely travel.  Ban the nuts and see how many more families get onboard.  Airline revenues will probably go up and that's a good thing.
BTW, I've been in 6 countries in the last 6 months, so I consider myself a frequent flyer.

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,99,772,"Because an airport cabin is a confined space (with limited outside air circulation) there is a very real possibility that a person with a peanut allergy could actually die from exposure.  There is absolutely no need for other passengers to have peanuts with a total disregard for the safety (and life) of a fellow passenger.

A similar problem, that should also be addressed, along with the peanut allergy problem, is the case of allowing small domestic pets in the cabin of a aircraft.  People with allergic sensitivity to dog and cat dander are in danger of dying from an acute asthma attack.  These animals are being stored under the seat in front of the pet owner which may be directly under an asthmatic passenger.  Additionally, many pet owners do not keep these animals in their carriers for the entire flight which increases the chance of exposure. Even when there are no animals on a particular flight, their presence on previous flights (and the lack of thorough cleaning) means that their dander is still present and a hazard to asthma sufferers.  Service animals are often allowed on the seats of many flights by the cabin crews which can be deadly to an asthmatic occupying that seat on a subsequent flight.","Thank you for sharing your concerns about peanut allergies and pet dander in airport cabins.

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,46,703,"The only additions to an airfare should be government mandated taxes and fees. 

""Surcharges"" should not be allowed in any case. Fuel, for example, is part of the airline's basic cost. It should not be an add on to a fare, but part of it. 

If an airline wants to charge more on a certain day, the base fare should include that charge. It should never be added on.

And the proposed rule that the total fare be shown is the only appropriate way to avoid deceptive practices. If an airline wishes to inform a customer about the cost of taxes, is should be allowed to list the base fare before taxes in no greater than 1/2 the typeface of the total fare along with the total fare.

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,59,663,"Regardless of the formula used by airlines to compensate bumped passengers or even if flights are delayed for over 3 hours that fact remains ailines are not forthcomiong with passengers about their rights.  Example: Flight delay due to mechanical problem with an anticpated wait time of 3 hours.  Technically the airline is required to compensate passengers with a meal voucher.  It's been my experience you'll get the voucher but only if you ask. Many families & individuals traveling are on a budget - that 3 hour delay can kill a budget for unexpected meals.  Airlines should be required to announce and post on the gate flight board that  passengers can claim a meal voucher during the delay.  Vouchers ahould be handy to the airliner's customer service staff at the gate.

It's all about establishing systems that are clear and protocol is established.  That means if a flight is delayed longer than 3 hours or a passenger is bumped as system is in place that is tranparent to airline personell and airline customers.  No tiny font but rather written in a conspicuous place, in large font, and clear to all what the policy is, how it is applied and what process is used for a passenger to receive compensation - be it a meal voucher or for being bumped.  Clear and understandable to all with no opportunity for any airline or passenger to work the system.","Thank you for your comments, jherbert, and welcome to Regulation Room.

I'm a relatively young man and I have a heart condition which can stop me from breathing in a ""heart beat"" and send me into cardiac arrest and every time I get on a flight I fear for my life a little since there is no emergency room with a doctor on a plane. Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about this condition I have except bring my meds and hope for the best.  With this in mind, I have to say that I personally would give up my right to eat peanuts if it could alleviate this same sort of drama for someone else.

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,20,709,"I have been allergic to peanuts for nearly 40-years!  I typically fly Southwest Airlines - a leading airline in distributing peanuts to passengers as THE ONLY SNACK on many of their flights.  After a typical flight, I will have itchy, watery eyes sometimes to the point where I can barely keep my eyes open.  Luckily my allergy is not AS BAD as many - but I can empathize with those with worse conditions.  In Southwest's defense, if I would call ahead of time and inform them I was allergic to peanuts they would gladly air out the aircraft and refrain from serving peanuts on my flight.  Although I am not against the idea of peanuts being restricted from all flights, I do appreciate people's comments regarding the absurdity of such an all-encompassing rule.  I think an effective and simple solution might be to ask passengers either verbally when tickets are purchased person-to-person, or via a question prior to an e-ticket purchase that asks the traveler if they are allergic to peanuts.  If yes - then that particular flight can be aired out of prior peanuts and peanuts not served on that flight.  I look forward to seeing the outcome to this issue.","Thanks for your comment, peanut allergy sufferer.

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,24,787,"TELL THE TRUTH immediately, boys, and treat passengers like valued human beings. That's it. 

Southwest does it, and they have the most loyal passengers in the industry. It CAN be done, if you have the will to do it. The price SW shows online is the REAL price, not a teaser fare that shoots up rapidly when the taxes, fees, surcharges, etc. are added.  SW does not charge me nuisance fees (baggage, changing a reservation, one-way flights, etc.). If they can do it, so can the rest of you. I just wish BWI were closer to the Northern VA location I frequent, so I could use SW all the time. 

I fly at least once every week, usually between Columbus, OH and the DC area. During the past year the Sunday night delays on USAir (DCA-CMH), United (IAD-CMH), and even SW (BWI-CMH) in that order have been abismal, with delays at LEAST 30-50% of the time. When cancellations were made, passengers weren't told until 5-10 minutes before departure. These have mostly been mechanical problems (clearly avoidable with better management), crew shortages, and non-severe weather. Efficient, effective management would prevent the vast majority of these problems. 

One brief example will illustrate. On Sunday, June 13 I was scheduled on US3234 DCA-CMH at 4:55 pm. When I arrived at the gate the plane and crew were there. Good start, eh? At about 10 min. before boarding time the gate agent said they'd made a minor repair to the plane, but the paperwork had not arrived from BRAZIL! ""We'll know more in 30 minutes."" This went on until after 7 pm, at which time I re-booked for the next morning and went home. The plane did eventually fly, 3 hours late, but meanwhile I've wasted 5 hours sitting at an overheated, overcrowded, hopelessly noisy National Airport because USAir can't get paperwork faxed from BRAZIL. Why did it have to come from Brazil? Why don't they have back up plans/management solutions for such routine problems. They are bound to occur. Plan for it and head off these problems. 

During last winter's blizzards in the East, SW was the only airline that told the truth and notified us many hours in advance that flights were cancelled. United and USAir constantly insisted the flights were going, when in fact they were not.  

If the carriers want the privilege of using our air space and our public airports (supported with tax-payer subsidies), they should be held to this standard. TELL THE TRUTH AS SOON AS YOU KNOW IT, and fix the problem promptly if it's anything other than severe weather that is truly beyond your control. PERIOD. Why wait 30 minutes unnecessarily?

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,6,803,"I thought the question wasn't about foreign carriers, but about international flights on all carriers.

We must understand that other governments may not view these rules as being benign and could very well impose restrictions on US carriers. Beware the law of unforeseen consequences.

The tarmac delay problem is not caused by airlines, and in particular foreign airlines. To submit them to significant operational or financial consequences because of something outside of their control doesn't seem appropriate.

Lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the FAA and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots. Eurocontrol (the FAA's equivalent) directs European airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport (or airspace) cannot provide it's expected capacity. When this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport. In the US when 'stuff' happens it becomes the airlines problem and they have to sort it out themselves. (competition law prohibits them from discussing solutions with their competitors). 

Let's fix the problem, not the symptoms.","Thank you for sharing your thoughtful perspective on the tarmac delay problem and its potential impact on international flights.

The requirements should definitely be applied to international flights as the tarmac time added to flight times can make for a very long time sitting in a cramped space.

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,97,768,"Let them overbook, but make it painful if they deny boarding.  The suggested penalties are not strong enough.   The penalty should apply to all ticket holders except for company employees traveling on free tickets as part of their job.  

First and foremost, whatever the penalty it must be paid in check or credit to a credit card immediately at the gate.  No more vouchers, which tend to be be worthless because of the airlines travel rules and restrictions.  

The starting point for the penalty should be the full fare cost of the ticket in whatever class the original ticket was issued.  So full Y, B, or F fare; no discount.  It should include all fees and taxes that would apply to the ticket if purchased by the consumer.  (This gets DOT out of the business of determining the value and worrying about inflation adjusted costs; the airline has already done the computation of the value of the ticket.)  The consumer should also be booked at the airlines expense on the next available flight in the same class as the original ticket.  

For every subsequent denied boarding for the consumer, they should get the same amount as the original payment to thus encourage the airline to get the passenger to their destination.

Airlines should not be allowed to offer any reduction to this penalty but could offer more in order to get passengers to deplane.  Vouchers do not count; only cash incentives should be allowed.

The penalty should apply to any size commercial flight whether it be five, ten, or 300 seats.  

Only when the penalty for over booking is truly onerous will the airlines stop this despicable practice.  I have no sympathy for the airline as 90% of the tickets they sell are non-refundable and non-cancelable; so they cannot be used and the airline gets its money. 

As to the argument that costs will increase, etc., then let the airlines sell a standby ticket which is not subject to these rules and penalties and let the consumer decide if they want to take the risk.  However, knowing how the airlines work, no more than 5% of all tickets sold nor more than 5% of total seat capacity of the flight (whichever is less) should be permitted to be sold in this special category (otherwise they would immediately sell all their seats like this to avoid the penalties.)  

Good luck.  I don't envy you up against the lawyers the airlines have on their payroll to say nothing of the pressure the airlines will exert on congress to get this watered down.

Between the security (no liquids, etc.) and the baggage fees pretty soon you won't be able to take anything with you at all. The cost of the ticket is already ridiculously high. Instead of charging us, perhaps they need to bring in consultants and auditors to see just where their money is going (into executive's pockets) and see how they can be more efficient with the money they are already extorting.

I've actually found it's now cheaper to ship my items Fed Ex than it is to bring them with me on the plane. AND they get there! On time!

I totally agree if the airline loses the luggage or it's delayed they should have to refund the fee they charged. They did not provide the service you paid for, end of story.

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,68,656,"A regulation that will force the air carriers to prominently display the various fees that are required is a good idea so that you know before you fly just how much more your ticket really is going to cost (i.e. bag fees, seat fee, etc.). Optional price for a meal or entertainment is ""nice to know"" information but I don't think it needs to be written as a regulation since you have the option of not watching a movie but you likely don't have the option of not bringing that suitcase along. The website notification is a good idea but it would also be good to have these posted in the check-in area as well.
The idea of a full fair price with every optional cost added in is not realistic since the majority of people do not use ALL of the options.  I do like the add-on services idea.
It's not the job of the airlines however to tell you that their competition may have a cheaper flight for you. Sorry, that's the consumer's job.

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,52,700,"I am a mother if a three year old with nut (including peanuts and cashews) and egg allergies.  I also support any ban on foods with peanut ingredients on airplanes.  We try to avoid airlines that serve peanuts, but that is becoming more difficult in this economy where we are trying to save any where we can and airlines are merging.  We have family in Europe and used to fly Northwest with our son, however, since they have merged with Delta that is now our least expensive option (we average $2,500 - $3,500 in tickets each time we fly, so price does make a difference).  Delta serves nuts.  

My son did have a reaction on one flights.  He did not eat nuts, and neither did anyone in our row, we believe he came in contact with the nuts from someone who had sat in our seats on a previous flight.  Luckily the reaction was not severe, we could control it with medicine, but when you have a 16 month old reacting at 35,000 feet, it can be very scary.  

Then next time we flew where the airline served nuts, we told them of the allergy when we bought the tickets and when we checked in.  I felt very discriminated by a few comments we received from airline personnel.   One flight attendant got angry that he wasn't told in advance and later blamed me when he ran out of non nut snacks when asked for a bag of pretzels (they created a ""peanut free area"" around us).  Another flight attendant announced to the plane that they would not be serving nut products because there was a small child with a nut allergy.  I felt like my family was singled out because it was a small flight and we were the only family with a small child.  

Please change the law to remove nuts from flights, no child's life is worth the risk.","I'm so grateful for your personal experience and the challenges you've faced as a parent of a child with severe allergies.

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,10,719,"I have been watching this discussion for a couple of days now, and want to weigh in on a few issues that have been raised by both supporters and opponents of a proposed peanut ban. 

First, I find that most of the discussion has been focusing on children with allergies, and related to that, good parenting. This is certainly understandable, given the increase in peanut allergies among children. But it neglects another perspective - namely, the adult allergy sufferer. 

I've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 (and I am now in my late 20s). By the age of 6, I knew how to take my medications myself. Since the EpiPen has come out, I've carried epinephrine with me. And I've always had various other medications - e.g. inhaler - on hand. I would never expect an airline to have such medications on hand, though I would expect them to have a first-aid kit.

Opponents of the ban suggest that allergy sufferers simply avoid flying. It might be possible when the sufferer is a child - perhaps it is possible for a family to drive to grandma's house for Christmas instead of taking a plane. This depends, of course, on where grandma lives - if she lives in California, and the family lives in Maine, there might be problems.

Adults, on the other hand, travel by air for a myriad of reasons. As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one. 

Towards the end of graduate school, I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them. For offices that were far away, I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city. I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air, but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication. I've had allergies since the age of 2, so I understand that sometimes, my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others. But when I take all necessary precautions and still, my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one, because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts, isn't that a little ridiculous? Is this really a fair result? I shudder to think what life will be like when I am a ""full-fledged"" working adult. Will I have to forgo promotions because I cannot travel on peanut-laden flights? It sounds dramatic, but it's not melodramatic. The only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights.","Welcome to Regulation Room, and thank you for your comment, sbell.

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,9,733,"I would like to add on to Javier's comment. It is true that the quality of delay information is not always within the airline's control. Often, when the FAA institutes the practice of ""metering"" due to weather or high volume, the airline really can't advise the customers of the reason for a delay. In fact, in order to retain the right to take off, the airlines are required to load the plane and sit on the tarmac while the FAA figures out how to route traffic. 

Furthermore, having listened to ground control/tower communications on United flights, it's clear that the controllers can give an estimated delay, but that delay is subject to change. Again, the airline's information is only as good as the FAA's information - and, well, the situation is fluid.

Perhaps instead of banning peanuts and peanut products outright. Airlines and the DOT can provide sufferers with HEPA airmasks which I assume will prevent individuals from inhaling peanut dust.

If touch is a problem dressing accordingly (i.e. long clothes for the trip to minimize touching surfaces)can help decrease the amount.

That said, it seems arbitrary to ban peanuts and not tree nuts given the likelihood of a serious reaction is fairly similar. If the airlines could have precautions in place, such as keeping an epipen available or offering surgical masks to those who need then, that would be a positive step. However, supplying those items really should be the responsibility of the person with the allergy or, if it is a child, the caretaker. Further, the logistics of implementing such a ban would be almost impossible.

Having said that, how exactly would such a ban on peanuts be enforced? I was on a Southwest flight not long ago, where a mom demanded that peanuts not be served on her flight with her daughter. The flight attendants complied. Mind you, this was Southwest Airlines, which had the marketing tagline ""We Fly For Peanuts"" for years. Common sense dictates that if your daughter has a severe peanut allergy, YOU DON'T FLY SOUTHWEST. Even if the crew agrees to suspend peanut service for this flight, the last flight served peanuts. There are discarded peanut bags in the seat back pocket in front of your daughter. Peanut dust is on the seats, in the ventilation, and everywhere else. How will keeping peanuts off of THIS leg of the flight protect you or your child? And even if peanuts are not served on that leg, if there's still an allergic reaction, how does that affect the airline's liability, or the liability of other passengers who might have eaten peanuts in the gate area and boarded with peanut dust on their hands?
On the same flight I, and many friends of mine who also travel frequently, each had a bag of nuts in our carry-on. Forget for a moment that it would be impossible (if not unconstitutional) for flight crew to prevent people from eating their own snacks while flying. The mere fact that I had an open bag of nuts in my carry-on - even if I never took it out - could have been enough to trigger this girl's allergy. The slippery-slope potential here boggles the mind. (You had peanut butter on your bagel for breakfast this morning? Sorry, sir, you can't board this flight.)
You will never convince peanut allergy sufferers or their families that this should not be controlled, and I can see their point without agreeing with it. Consider this: I am violently allergic to dogs and cats, yet most mass-market airlines now allow pets to be stowed in the passenger compartment. I don't recall anyone ever asking me if my health would be compromised by allowing pet dander aboard. I don't protest, because I am responsible for controlling my own allergies, whether that means carrying a dust mask or an epi-pen aboard. If I choose to fly, I alone must be responsible for my own health.

While I have been fortunate enough to not experience an anaphylactic reaction in my son, I have seen patients with anaphylactic reactions.  They are terrifying for everyone involved, even in situations where you are surrounded by trained staff, abundant medications and crash carts. 

The way I see this issue is that it is balancing the risks and benefits of peanuts on planes.  The risks are pretty obvious and encompass death and less severe reactions that, at a minimum, are likely to result in an emergency landing.

The benefits of serving peanuts on planes are limited to the fact that most people like peanuts and they are fairly inexpensive.

I have seen on this discussion board arguments that people have the right to eat peanuts, that people with allergies should wear masks or other personal protective equipment (extending to full body suits), that people with allergies should not fly, etc...  These arguments seem somewhat petty, impractical, and outdated, respectively.  Petty because it is not a major sacrifice to go without a bag of peanuts.  Impractical because trying to keep an N95 (particulate) mask on a young child for up to 6 hours just cannot happen.  Outdated because in modern US society with families spread across the nation travel is often the norm.

For people who say 'Just don't travel on planes', I assert that they are missing the point.  It is not as if dealing with a severe allergy is not already lifestyle altering.  I will never be able to take my son to a major league baseball park; we will never be able to go down the street for ice cream on a hot summer day; we cannot go to a Chinese restaurant.  This is all OK because these are luxuries.  Furthermore, if we somehow do find ourselves in a hazardous situation, we can just get up and leave.  On an airplane, that is not an option.  There is no getting up and leaving (and just the act of changing your seat is a challenge).

So, the way I see it is that the risks associated with serving peanuts in a closed environment where the ability to provide medical care is limited clearly outweigh the benefits of serving peanuts both on a societal and cultural level (because the very real risk faced by children and adults with severe peanut allergies far exceeds the benefit of airlines serving peanuts).

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,29,676,"My daughter is allergic to peanut and tree nut.  The problem with this allergy, is that anaphylaxis can occur from ANY contact with peanut.  This includes airborne inhalation, cross contamination with other foods, or contact with residue left from previous and nearby passengers.  It is not simply a matter of ""don't eat it.""  It is well-known that Epipens address anaphylaxis on a SHORT TERM basis.  The effects of the Epipen last for 15 or 20 minutes, but if the medication wears off, the individual can resume their life-threatening reaction.  On the ground, after the use of an Epipen, you are supposed to go immediately to the emergency room because you may need further treatment to save your life.  In the air, you don't have that option.  I believe the current diagnosis rate of peanut allergy is almost 1 in 100 children.  That is a HUGE percentage of the population that is at risk by flying in an airplane.

I agree with the fact that if a driver or company can not comply with the rules then they should be required to have them.  As a former owner-operator I feel there is enough expense in having the truck and all the expenses that goes with it without anything else being put on the owner or company to purchase.  There are already so many things a driver is responsible for without adding anything else.  The EOBR would just be one more thing they would have to keep up with.  A paper log is easy you just mark it when you stop and again when you leave.  No electronics involved in doing that. I do not see how the EOBR will improve safety either.  If a driver does not break the rules and sticks to the HOS then there will be no safety issues because he or she will have done what they are supposed to without the EORB.

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,35,660,There must be a complete ban on tree nuts and peanuts on planes.  It is a closed space. I am allergic to peanuts and almonds and I am impacted every time I fly.  A nut free zone does not work since the dust from nuts gets in the closed air system of the plane.  For the time that people are on planes there should be consideration of others who have no control as to the reactions they have to nuts.  For almost all other foods the allergy only occurs if the food is ingested so you can easily avoid the allergic reaction but not eating the food.  This is not true for many of us with nut allergies - we react if other people are eating the food since it is an airborne allergy.  I do fly but I have to take multiple Benadryl pills every 4 hours to keep from reacting to the airborne dust of the nuts.  This works for now but I always wonder when it will no longer be enough.  An epipen is not the answer as it lasts only look enough for the plane to land which is not a practical solution when you are flying on a long flight over water and would certainly be a much greater inconvenience to the other passengers than a ban on nut products on planes if the plane was able to land.  The rules airlines have are ridiculous - Southwest is not nut free they will not serve nuts but if you fly a late flight the peanuts are all over the floor and seats.  Some other airlines have the rows around you 'nut free' but advise you they can do nothing if the person seated next to you brings nuts on and wants to eat them.  Other airlines with advance notice will not serve nuts but all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts and will not stop the person from eating them if they wish to.  So you can have a 'nut free' flight and the person sitting next to you can take out their package of peanuts and eat away - and the airlines will do nothing to help you. Again all nuts should be banned from airplanes unless it is your own private plane - then go ahead and eat what you want. ,"Thank you for sharing your personal experience and concerns about airborne nut allergies on planes.

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,65,651,"I have two children with potentially life threatening allergies to peanuts.   Unlike what one person commented, this is not a latest illness fad.  The latest research indicates that peanut allergy doubled in children from 1997 to 2002 and that number continues to increase.   It is one of the most deadly food allergies.  

The presence of nuts on planes is a real fear.  While my kids have other potentially deadly food allergies, peanuts pose a unique risk.  Nuts break into fine pieces with dust that can become airborne.    Peanut butter is sticky and gets wiped on seats and tray tables.     Even the slightest microscopic amount of nuts can create an anaphylactic reaction.  

Although EpiPens can help, they are not 100% effective and should not be considered a solution to the risk peanuts pose to allergic individuals on planes.  Additional steroids, Benadryl shots, oxygen and other medical intervention may be necessary to stop an anaphylactic reaction.    EpiPens may need to be administered every 15 to 30 minutes as well.  People still die even with intervention.

Please help protect people by offering people the opportunity to get peanut free flights or ban the sale and serving of nut products on the planes.

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,24,787,"TELL THE TRUTH immediately, boys, and treat passengers like valued human beings. That's it. 

Southwest does it, and they have the most loyal passengers in the industry. It CAN be done, if you have the will to do it. The price SW shows online is the REAL price, not a teaser fare that shoots up rapidly when the taxes, fees, surcharges, etc. are added.  SW does not charge me nuisance fees (baggage, changing a reservation, one-way flights, etc.). If they can do it, so can the rest of you. I just wish BWI were closer to the Northern VA location I frequent, so I could use SW all the time. 

I fly at least once every week, usually between Columbus, OH and the DC area. During the past year the Sunday night delays on USAir (DCA-CMH), United (IAD-CMH), and even SW (BWI-CMH) in that order have been abismal, with delays at LEAST 30-50% of the time. When cancellations were made, passengers weren't told until 5-10 minutes before departure. These have mostly been mechanical problems (clearly avoidable with better management), crew shortages, and non-severe weather. Efficient, effective management would prevent the vast majority of these problems. 

One brief example will illustrate. On Sunday, June 13 I was scheduled on US3234 DCA-CMH at 4:55 pm. When I arrived at the gate the plane and crew were there. Good start, eh? At about 10 min. before boarding time the gate agent said they'd made a minor repair to the plane, but the paperwork had not arrived from BRAZIL! ""We'll know more in 30 minutes."" This went on until after 7 pm, at which time I re-booked for the next morning and went home. The plane did eventually fly, 3 hours late, but meanwhile I've wasted 5 hours sitting at an overheated, overcrowded, hopelessly noisy National Airport because USAir can't get paperwork faxed from BRAZIL. Why did it have to come from Brazil? Why don't they have back up plans/management solutions for such routine problems. They are bound to occur. Plan for it and head off these problems. 

During last winter's blizzards in the East, SW was the only airline that told the truth and notified us many hours in advance that flights were cancelled. United and USAir constantly insisted the flights were going, when in fact they were not.  

If the carriers want the privilege of using our air space and our public airports (supported with tax-payer subsidies), they should be held to this standard.

Lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the FAA and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots. Eurocontrol (the FAA's equivalent) directs European airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport (or airspace) cannot provide it's expected capacity. When this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport.

I would like to add that airports should also have contingency plans, if they do not then anytime there is a delay allowing for passengers to deplane will be disrutpive and would then not be required. 
The size of the plane or number of seats should not matter, the concerns and inconvenience are the same.
The requirements should definitely be applied to international flights as the tarmac time added to flight times can make for a very long time sitting in a cramped space. 
I feel that if the plane is still at the gate (whether the door has been closed or not) passengers should be given the opportunity to deplane if delayed by more than 1.5 hours. Also passengers shouod be allowed to use the bathrooms at anytime during a delay.

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,97,768,"Let them overbook, but make it painful if they deny boarding.  The suggested penalties are not strong enough.   The penalty should apply to all ticket holders except for company employees traveling on free tickets as part of their job.  

First and foremost, whatever the penalty it must be paid in check or credit to a credit card immediately at the gate.  No more vouchers, which tend to be be worthless because of the airlines travel rules and restrictions.  

The starting point for the penalty should be the full fare cost of the ticket in whatever class the original ticket was issued.  So full Y, B, or F fare; no discount.  It should include all fees and taxes that would apply to the ticket if purchased by the consumer.  (This gets DOT out of the business of determining the value and worrying about inflation adjusted costs; the airline has already done the computation of the value of the ticket.)  The consumer should also be booked at the airlines expense on the next available flight in the same class as the original ticket.  

For every subsequent denied boarding for the consumer, they should get the same amount as the original payment to thus encourage the airline to get the passenger to their destination.

Airlines should not be allowed to offer any reduction to this penalty but could offer more in order to get passengers to deplane.  Vouchers do not count; only cash incentives should be allowed.

The penalty should apply to any size commercial flight whether it be five, ten, or 300 seats.  

Only when the penalty for over booking is truly onerous will the airlines stop this despicable practice.  I have no sympathy for the airline as 90% of the tickets they sell are non-refundable and non-cancelable; so they cannot be used and the airline gets its money. 

As to the argument that costs will increase, etc., then let the airlines sell a standby ticket which is not subject to these rules and penalties and let the consumer decide if they want to take the risk.  However, knowing how the airlines work, no more than 5% of all tickets sold nor more than 5% of total seat capacity of the flight (whichever is less) should be permitted to be sold in this special category (otherwise they would immediately sell all their seats like this to avoid the penalties.)

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,83,635,"I have one child who is severely allergic to peanuts.  She is one of those few who react from dust, practically.  We made a decision at an early age simply not to fly.  The airlines have no cohesive, consistent policy and this issue is not something we can show up and be surprised about.

It would help children, and adults, like my daughter if the DOT banned peanuts on all flights.  Of course, asking airlines to stop serving peanuts is not enough.  The DOT would need to require that no passenger bring them aboard as well.  Let's face it, cuts to the airlines have put food at the bottom of their priority list (hence handing out ""snacks"" like peanuts).  So...if you will be flying for hours and have little prospect for food, what is the perfect protein packed food you can bring that needs no refrigeration?

I almost feel like banning peanuts would give people a false sense of security UNLESS a complete and total ban was instituted (airline & passengers).

That being said, I appreciate the argument about other allergies, as well as perfume (though I do not believe anaphylaxis is generally an issue for those allergic to perfume).  Why do we need food on board at all?  Perhaps that is a bit naive and narrow-minded, but how about a drinks-only rule?  Do 1 or 2 hours flights really need to serve ANY kind of food?  Propose that to the airlines as a cost saving measure!  (Of course, longer flights or international is a whole other ballgame.)

So, to answer the DOT questions over there <---- I would say:

1.  From empirical evidence, I believe there is a strong likelihood of a peanut allergy sufferer having a severe reaction if the conditions were right.  My daughter developed hives from peanut shell residue that had touched a banana peel.  She touched the peel to her skin and broke out in hives.  It doesn't take much.

2.  I feel strongly that people should take responsibility for themselves and, therefore, would expect all allergy sufferers to carry their own epinephrine.  However, I am under the assumption that a plane would have first aid available and possibly a defibrillator.  Adding epinephrine to this kit would only be a good business practice.

3.  I would feel (relatively) safe on a plane where peanut-ingredient products are banned from airline and passengers, but ""may contains"" were permitted.  My allergic daughter would not consume them, but the chance of her having a reaction from cross contact or inhalation are virtually nil.  Again, it's about personal responsibility.  We will take care of her food.  We just need help keeping her alive and safe from other peoples food.

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,22,721,"I'm a physician, epidemiologist, and mother to a four year old boy with allergies to milk, peanuts and egg.  My son's dairy allergy is severe, and he has had numerous life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk, which required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the Emergency Department.  Tests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse, but fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut; he put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild  reaction.  

I've traveled with my children and despite calling ahead, making requests, and reminding employees at the door, I've rarely had respect, let alone consistency, in any kind of peanut-free buffer zone or flight.  Several years ago Continental Airlines customer service headquarters informed me that they would serve peanuts on all flights as they were unable to guarantee a peanut free flight.  (So why not hand out weapons since they can't guarantee a weapon free flight either?)  

I've sat with my epi pen in hand on a filthy flight with visible peanut crumbs on the floor while a flight attendant insisted on offering peanuts to the passengers around me because ""it was their right.""  

Fortunately for me, my son's peanut allergy is not severe enough that it prohibits us from air travel.  Now that he is old enough to not put things in his mouth, and to protect himself, we are safer.   However, I know of many, many others in the allergy community, children and adults who simply can NOT fly.  

My son's dairy allergy is quite severe.  The world would be a much safer place for us if no one consumed milk near him.  If his skin touches anything that once touched milk, even if it was partially cleaned, he will get severe hives.  If he consumes even less than a drop, within seconds his lips, eyes and face will swell, he will be covered in hives, vomit, and be gasping for breath.  Without epinephrine he would probably die within minutes.  But milk is ubiquitous, and milk allergy relatively uncommon, so we must protect ourselves.  Peanut allergy is common, and it is a simple step to serve an alternative peanut based snacks for a short period of time.  So why is this a big problem?

The vast majority of potential reactions would be eliminated by simply avoiding snacks that have peanuts or peanut butter as an ingredient.  Peanut oil is known to contain very little of the actual peanut protein, and would be of little risk in an airborne environment.  

As a physician, I have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance.  I am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane.  In addition, most epi-pens come in two pack doses, each of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes.  Which in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS.

I've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive, and are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety.  I think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.  Of course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face.  But I am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.  This restriction is designed to protect people with allergies from the airlines callous disregard for cleanliness and for our safety, not from our fellow passengers.

My son wanted to also write a letter.

""Hi.  My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.  I am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.  If I eat a peanut I'll get sick. I ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.  It was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.  I would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.  Everybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.""

It is also important for crew to alert passengers through a public announcement and ask them not to eat peanuts that they have brought on board.

Otherwise, airlines will bump passengers who paid a lower fare.

Second, either the creation of a buffer-zone or removal of peanuts base on a passenger's request is impractical. What if there are multiple allergy sufferers on the plane? Finding appropriate seat arrangements for everyone is completely impractical and time-consuming, delaying take-off. It also distracts flight attendants from completing their job. Second, among all of the other things a passenger needs to be keep in mind when traveling, notifying the airline of a peanut allergy should not be one of them. And when should the airline be notified? When is it too late to do so? And if it is too late, then what happens if someone has an allergic reaction on the plane?

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,10,719,"I have been watching this discussion for a couple of days now, and want to weigh in on a few issues that have been raised by both supporters and opponents of a proposed peanut ban. 

First, I find that most of the discussion has been focusing on children with allergies, and related to that, good parenting. This is certainly understandable, given the increase in peanut allergies among children. But it neglects another perspective - namely, the adult allergy sufferer. 

I've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 (and I am now in my late 20s). By the age of 6, I knew how to take my medications myself. Since the EpiPen has come out, I've carried epinephrine with me. And I've always had various other medications - e.g. inhaler - on hand. I would never expect an airline to have such medications on hand, though I would expect them to have a first-aid kit.

Opponents of the ban suggest that allergy sufferers simply avoid flying. It might be possible when the sufferer is a child - perhaps it is possible for a family to drive to grandma's house for Christmas instead of taking a plane. This depends, of course, on where grandma lives - if she lives in California, and the family lives in Maine, there might be problems.

Adults, on the other hand, travel by air for a myriad of reasons. As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one. 

Towards the end of graduate school, I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them. For offices that were far away, I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city. I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air, but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication. I've had allergies since the age of 2, so I understand that sometimes, my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others. But when I take all necessary precautions and still, my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one, because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts, isn't that a little ridiculous? Is this really a fair result? I shudder to think what life will be like when I am a ""full-fledged"" working adult. Will I have to forgo promotions because I cannot travel on peanut-laden flights? It sounds dramatic, but it's not melodramatic. The only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights.","Welcome to Regulation Room, and thank you for your comment, sbell.

Perhaps instead of banning peanuts and peanut products outright. Airlines and the DOT can provide sufferers with HEPA airmasks which I assume will prevent individuals from inhaling peanut dust. I would think this approach would be of minimal cost (air filters can be bought for about $20 or less) and would not require a ban. If touch is a problem dressing accordingly (i.e. long clothes for the trip to minimize touching surfaces)can help decrease the amount.

That said, it seems arbitrary to ban peanuts and not tree nuts given the likelihood of a serious reaction is fairly similar. If the airlines could have precautions in place, such as keeping an epipen available or offering surgical masks to those who need then, that would be a positive step. However, supplying those items really should be the responsibility of the person with the allergy or, if it is a child, the caretaker. Further, the logistics of implementing such a ban would be almost impossible. Are we looking at searching passenger luggage, banning the sale of all foods with peanuts (and since most carry the ""made in a facility that also handles"", you'd be looking at eliminating almost all foods) and regulating all restaurants at airports as well? Unfortunately, personal responsibility and proactive steps on the part of the person with the allergy is likely the only viable solution.","Thanks for your comments.

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,79,754,"I am the father of a 5-year old with a severe peanut allergy as well as a physician and a medical epidemiologist.  While I have been fortunate enough to not experience an anaphylactic reaction in my son, I have seen patients with anaphylactic reactions.  They are terrifying for everyone involved, even in situations where you are surrounded by trained staff, abundant medications and crash carts. 

The way I see this issue is that it is balancing the risks and benefits of peanuts on planes.  The risks are pretty obvious and encompass death and less severe reactions that, at a minimum, are likely to result in an emergency landing.

The benefits of serving peanuts on planes are limited to the fact that most people like peanuts and they are fairly inexpensive.

I have seen on this discussion board arguments that people have the right to eat peanuts, that people with allergies should wear masks or other personal protective equipment (extending to full body suits), that people with allergies should not fly, etc...  These arguments seem somewhat petty, impractical, and outdated, respectively.  Petty because it is not a major sacrifice to go without a bag of peanuts.  Impractical because trying to keep an N95 (particulate) mask on a young child for up to 6 hours just cannot happen.  Outdated because in modern US society with families spread across the nation travel is often the norm.

For people who say 'Just don't travel on planes', I assert that they are missing the point.  It is not as if dealing with a severe allergy is not already lifestyle altering.  I will never be able to take my son to a major league baseball park; we will never be able to go down the street for ice cream on a hot summer day; we cannot go to a Chinese restaurant.  This is all OK because these are luxuries.  Furthermore, if we somehow do find ourselves in a hazardous situation, we can just get up and leave.  On an airplane, that is not an option.  There is no getting up and leaving (and just the act of changing your seat is a challenge).

So, the way I see it is that the risks associated with serving peanuts in a closed environment where the ability to provide medical care is limited clearly outweigh the benefits of serving peanuts both on a societal and cultural level (because the very real risk faced by children and adults with severe peanut allergies far exceeds the benefit of airlines serving peanuts).

Anaphylaxis can happen much more readily for him by the transfer of oils (peanut oils on airline tray tables, arm rests). It can also happen by airborne dust.  In a flight where peanuts are being served and all 100+ bags go POOF at the same time they are opened - well, let's just say it would be a mother's nightmare.  Especialy with recycled cabin air.  Even without a peanut allergy, peanuts are just such a choking hazard for any small children.  Why serve them?  There are plenty of reasonable alternatives.  I recall when my son was first diagnosed, 1 week prior to Christmas.  Our pediatrician called us at all of our nighttime emergency numbers just to ensure we wouldn't step onto any holiday airline flights without an epi-pen and proper documentation of his condition.  I was FLOORED to f sind out that Delta still served peanuts.  Really??  Peanut allergy is unlike some other food allergies in that there are multiple ways to have reaction (ingestion, touching, breathing).  My suggestion would be to ban peanut products on all airlines.  But that still does not/will  not control what snacks others bring on.  So I would suggest they still offer peanut free buffer zones and have some method of ensuring passengers in those rows are aware of what that means (don't bring or open peanut snacks). I also think that pre-boarding should be an option, so that peanut families can go and wipe down the tray tables/arm rests themselves and feel comfortable with the environment in which their child will be sitting. I've been on one too many flights were peanuts have been banned simply due to an allergic person flying...and I feel SO MUCH sympathy for those families, because the airline staff does not seem to be good at respecting their privacy. In fact, they almost act begruding or point out the poor child to other.  What kid wants to be labeled?  In all honesty, I can't see making the switch to peanut free snacks to be that big an impact to the airlines. As long as items are clearly labeled (most, not all pretzels) are o.k.  If nothing else, I am so very appreciative that this issue is gaining attention.  I don't think airlines realize how many passengers don't fly them due to their poor policies.

Nuts break into fine pieces with dust that can become airborne.    Peanut butter is sticky and gets wiped on seats and tray tables.     Even the slightest microscopic amount of nuts can create an anaphylactic reaction.  

Although EpiPens can help, they are not 100% effective and should not be considered a solution to the risk peanuts pose to allergic individuals on planes.  Additional steroids, Benadryl shots, oxygen and other medical intervention may be necessary to stop an anaphylactic reaction.    EpiPens may need to be administered every 15 to 30 minutes as well.  People still die even with intervention.

Please help protect people by offering people the opportunity to get peanut free flights or ban the sale and serving of nut products on the planes.

a)  those who believe that it is right to help the few to live life to the fullest of their abilities, and 
b) those who believe that no-one has the right to pass laws they do not agree with .
And it is very obvious that a consensus will not be agreed upon here.

I would like to thank the DOT for having the courage to bring this matter up and to ask for comments from the public, especially after being told by Congress in 1998 to drop the matter or risk having funding removed. No doubt the peanut lobby played a major part in that directive.

Those who have legitimate life threatening allergies (and there are many) have a right to be heard. Unfortunately, there appear to be many who wish to snuff out these voices because certain rights may be impeded.

 Congress should listen to the doctors and scientists who study these disabilities and allow the experts to make their honest recommendations. I understand that the peanut lobby will probably want their say, but money should not outweigh logic and science.

I would prefer a total ban on peanut and tree nut foods being served on flights. 

My granddaughter has been medically diagnosed as having several allergies, including these two items. We are not hysterical, and we would be much happier if these allergies could disappear or be cured. Unfortunately, the science is not there yet. So, the family must all read labels, call companies when the labels are not clear, talk with restaurants, take ""safe"" food with us when no other solution is possible, and always carry a bag with any possibly required medications. We accept these as our responsibility.

We are restricted from being able to take family vacations very far from home because of the negative attitudes of the airline companies, or lack of choices because of living next to a Delta hub. This does not affect one person, this affects 12! I would have thought that the airlines would have taken this into account when looking at their bottom dollar, but Delta has stated that they will not restrict peanuts because their home is in Georgia! 

The negative comments from some of the writers posted here are not helpful in defining what is the correct solution to allow allergy sufferers, and their families, to fly.

We must understand that other governments may not view these rules as being benign and could very well impose restrictions on US carriers. Beware the law of unforeseen consequences.

The tarmac delay problem is not caused by airlines, and in particular foreign airlines. To submit them to significant operational or financial consequences because of something outside of their control doesn't seem appropriate.

Lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the FAA and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots. Eurocontrol (the FAA's equivalent) directs European airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport (or airspace) cannot provide it's expected capacity. When this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport. In the US when 'stuff' happens it becomes the airlines problem and they have to sort it out themselves. (competition law prohibits them from discussing solutions with their competitors).

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,83,635,"I have one child who is severely allergic to peanuts.  She is one of those few who react from dust, practically.  We made a decision at an early age simply not to fly.  The airlines have no cohesive, consistent policy and this issue is not something we can show up and be surprised about.

It would help children, and adults, like my daughter if the DOT banned peanuts on all flights.  Of course, asking airlines to stop serving peanuts is not enough.  The DOT would need to require that no passenger bring them aboard as well.  Let's face it, cuts to the airlines have put food at the bottom of their priority list (hence handing out ""snacks"" like peanuts).  So...if you will be flying for hours and have little prospect for food, what is the perfect protein packed food you can bring that needs no refrigeration?

I almost feel like banning peanuts would give people a false sense of security UNLESS a complete and total ban was instituted (airline & passengers).

That being said, I appreciate the argument about other allergies, as well as perfume (though I do not believe anaphylaxis is generally an issue for those allergic to perfume).  Why do we need food on board at all?  Perhaps that is a bit naive and narrow-minded, but how about a drinks-only rule?  Do 1 or 2 hours flights really need to serve ANY kind of food?  Propose that to the airlines as a cost saving measure!  (Of course, longer flights or international is a whole other ballgame.)

So, to answer the DOT questions over there <---- I would say:

1.  From empirical evidence, I believe there is a strong likelihood of a peanut allergy sufferer having a severe reaction if the conditions were right.  My daughter developed hives from peanut shell residue that had touched a banana peel.  She touched the peel to her skin and broke out in hives.  It doesn't take much.

2.  I feel strongly that people should take responsibility for themselves and, therefore, would expect all allergy sufferers to carry their own epinephrine.  However, I am under the assumption that a plane would have first aid available and possibly a defibrillator.  Adding epinephrine to this kit would only be a good business practice.

3.  I would feel (relatively) safe on a plane where peanut-ingredient products are banned from airline and passengers, but ""may contains"" were permitted.  My allergic daughter would not consume them, but the chance of her having a reaction from cross contact or inhalation are virtually nil.  Again, it's about personal responsibility.  We will take care of her food.  We just need help keeping her alive and safe from other peoples food.

CFPB wants to make sure that the rules it makes are effective for consumers, so it wants to know more about your ideas.  Do you have any suggestions for how CFPB can make sure that consumers know about the rules?"
63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,92,664,"Look folks, it is simple. Airlines can't afford empty seats on expensive jets burning expensive fuel. If you increase their costs, they either have to reduce their overbooking or pay the extra fees. Either which way, they will lose more money than they already are losing. If they don't overbook, there will be more empty seats costing them revenue. What will the result be? Higher fares, even higher change ticket fees (or stop allowing change tickets altogether and if you miss the flight, oh well), airlines going out of business (less competition & more unemployment). In the end, the airlines are NOT going to pay these fees. The customers pay these fees. EVERYTHING flows downhill. PERIOD! The low man on the pole always loses and make no mistake but the taxpayers and customers are the bottom of the pole. 

The rules should be simple. If you kick me off my flight, I should get a refund for that flight (not round trip) and be put on the next one at no cost. I've personally never been on a flight where people didn't just volunteer based on the airlines' attempt to bride passengers.","Welcome to Regulation Room and thank you for commenting, hotblazer. It sounds like you have had some personal experience with overbooking. Can you tell us more about that? CFPB is also interested in hearing about other people's experiences with overbooking.","Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the airline passenger rights.
