Passengers may lack check cashing privileges away from their home airport, yet face unplanned and likely elevated expenses after being ""bumped.""   They should have a mandatory option of cash payment.  An credit card credit, if immediate, would be more secure and as useful to more passengers than either a check or cash.

The proposed compensation limits are too low to provide an incentive to the airlines to limit overbooking and may be arbitrarily unfair to certain travelers.

There is absolutely no need for other passengers to have peanuts with a total disregard for the safety (and life) of a fellow passenger.

A similar problem, that should also be addressed, along with the peanut allergy problem, is the case of allowing small domestic pets in the cabin of a aircraft.  People with allergic sensitivity to dog and cat dander are in danger of dying from an acute asthma attack.  These animals are being stored under the seat in front of the pet owner which may be directly under an asthmatic passenger.  Additionally, many pet owners do not keep these animals in their carriers for the entire flight which increases the chance of exposure. Even when there are no animals on a particular flight, their presence on previous flights (and the lack of thorough cleaning) means that their dander is still present and a hazard to asthma sufferers.  Service animals are often allowed on the seats of many flights by the cabin crews which can be deadly to an asthmatic occupying that seat on a subsequent flight.","

1888,650,regroom_gen,"Hello and thank you for the opportunity to provide input on air travel procedures.  As someone that once logged 100+ flights per year for many years, I have experienced both the best and the worst of what air travel can provide.

I would like to offer some insights that hopefully will expand the scope of the regulation you are considering vis-à-vis airline-passenger communication.  From a passenger perspective, I believe there are actually three deficiencies that drive the current communication problem, and resulting shortcomings in the system:  (1) There is a major disconnect in information between gate agents and reservation agents; (2) There is no prompt communication between the airline and the passenger (as you correctly note here); and (3) There is no way to guarantee re-booking or re-routing, without penalty, without going to the airport.  As a result, even when there is a high likelihood that a flight will be canceled, passengers go to the airport, often at significant expense, then must wait in long lines, causing havoc inside the airport, and creating the inefficient system that we are all familiar with.  I believe these three together are the source of the problem and would like to illustrate this with a brief example:

This winter, I had a vacation booked to Colorado to ski.  On the day of travel there was heavy snow in New York City.  To me it was obvious that my flight would be canceled.  However, despite repeated calls to the airline, I was assured that the flight was showing to depart on-time (Problems 1 and 2).  However, knowing that if the flight did leave, even if that were 5 hours later, I would face a steep re-booking expense (change fee plus fare difference!), I went to the airport regardless (Problem 3).  Upon arrival at the airport, and after checking my skis curbside, my fears were of course confirmed, the flight had been canceled, and there were long lines at all of the agent counters and the gates.  I then waited in line for an hour, re-booked, waited another hour to collect my bag, and returned home.  The monetary expense for me was $150 in cab rides and tips, and 5 hours in time, and one day of lost skiing.  None of which was claimable/reimbursable.

So, I would like to suggest oversight/regulation of the following:  (1) Airlines should be required to invest in systems that streamline information so that information among their reservations agents is as current as it is at the gate; (2) In addition to notifying passengers about their flight promptly (30 minutes sounds reasonable), there should be earlier, and more frequent communication about overall ""Airport Health"" on the day of travel.  For example, just letting a passenger know about his/her flight in advance does not necessarily help at all.  If that communication comes less than 90 minutes before departure, it is outside of the window in which a passenger can react:  he/she is already on the way to the airport.  However, if an earlier communication were:  ""Due to heavy snow, all flights this morning have been departing 1-2 hours behind schedule.  Please prepare for delays/possibility of cancellation.  We will provide another status update in one hour.""  This is a communication that a passenger can thoughtfully incorporate into his/her planning.  Finally, (3) Rules should be developed defining the conditions under which a passenger can rebook without charge.  Perhaps if the flight is going to be delayed more than 3 hours, it is better for the passenger and the airline to let a passenger rebook.  Sometimes the flight is overbooked anyway.

I believe further consideration of the above collectively would result in a far better passenger experience, and more efficient airline management.  Thank you for considering my input.  RK","Thank you, RK, for sharing your valuable insights and personal experience with airline passenger rights.

The oils on your hands are on those fabric seats forever and the peanut POOF is in the ventilation system for everyone to breathe. In regards to medicines, someone mentioned earlier about a defibrillator being on board. They are prepared for heart problems but a child's first reaction to peanuts is just as likely and deadly, so maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to have one. Although, I can't imagine someone with a peanut allergy coming on board without their medicines. 
On a side note, someone commented about how this would only effect 1% of the population. I'm not sure about that number. But, I do know that out my family of 5, NONE of us can fly with my child... so not only does my son not fly, but we don't. I would venture to say that this is the same case for most families. So, much more than 1% would be e/affected.
Thanks for letting me give my thoughts. ","

1555,834,regroom_nomod,"Hello and thank you for the opportunity to provide input on air travel procedures.  As someone that once logged 100+ flights per year for many years, I have experienced both the best and the worst of what air travel can provide.

I would like to offer some insights that hopefully will expand the scope of the regulation you are considering vis-à-vis airline-passenger communication.  From a passenger perspective, I believe there are actually three deficiencies that drive the current communication problem, and resulting shortcomings in the system:  (1) There is a major disconnect in information between gate agents and reservation agents; (2) There is no prompt communication between the airline and the passenger (as you correctly note here); and (3) There is no way to guarantee re-booking or re-routing, without penalty, without going to the airport.  As a result, even when there is a high likelihood that a flight will be canceled, passengers go to the airport, often at significant expense, then must wait in long lines, causing havoc inside the airport, and creating the inefficient system that we are all familiar with.  I believe these three together are the source of the problem and would like to illustrate this with a brief example:

This winter, I had a vacation booked to Colorado to ski.  On the day of travel there was heavy snow in New York City.  To me it was obvious that my flight would be canceled.  However, despite repeated calls to the airline, I was assured that the flight was showing to depart on-time (Problems 1 and 2).  However, knowing that if the flight did leave, even if that were 5 hours later, I would face a steep re-booking expense (change fee plus fare difference!), I went to the airport regardless (Problem 3).  Upon arrival at the airport, and after checking my skis curbside, my fears were of course confirmed, the flight had been canceled, and there were long lines at all of the agent counters and the gates.  I then waited in line for an hour, re-booked, waited another hour to collect my bag, and returned home.  The monetary expense for me was $150 in cab rides and tips, and 5 hours in time, and one day of lost skiing.  None of which was claimable/reimbursable.

So, I would like to suggest oversight/regulation of the following:  (1) Airlines should be required to invest in systems that streamline information so that information among their reservations agents is as current as it is at the gate; (2) In addition to notifying passengers about their flight promptly (30 minutes sounds reasonable), there should be earlier, and more frequent communication about overall ""Airport Health"" on the day of travel.  For example, just letting a passenger know about his/her flight in advance does not necessarily help at all.  If that communication comes less than 90 minutes before departure, it is outside of the window in which a passenger can react:  he/she is already on the way to the airport.  However, if an earlier communication were:  ""Due to heavy snow, all flights this morning have been departing 1-2 hours behind schedule.  Please prepare for delays/possibility of cancellation.  We will provide another status update in one hour.""  This is a communication that a passenger can thoughtfully incorporate into his/her planning.  Finally, (3) Rules should be developed defining the conditions under which a passenger can rebook without charge.  Perhaps if the flight is going to be delayed more than 3 hours, it is better for the passenger and the airline to let a passenger rebook.  Sometimes the flight is overbooked anyway.

I believe further consideration of the above collectively would result in a far better passenger experience, and more efficient airline management.  Thank you for considering my input.

Between the security (no liquids, etc.) and the baggage fees pretty soon you won't be able to take anything with you at all. The cost of the ticket is already ridiculously high. Instead of charging us, perhaps they need to bring in consultants and auditors to see just where their money is going (into executive's pockets) and see how they can be more efficient with the money they are already extorting.

I've actually found it's now cheaper to ship my items Fed Ex than it is to bring them with me on the plane. AND they get there! On time!

I totally agree if the airline loses the luggage or it's delayed they should have to refund the fee they charged. They did not provide the service you paid for, end of story.

I completely agree ALL the fees should be listed when you buy that ticket. Prominently. You should know what you are going to be asked to pay for.

I have to say personally that if they start charging me a fee for putting a small bag in the overhead bin I will no longer be a customer. I will not fly any airline that does something so ridiculous.

I just talked to a Ms. DOT officer who told me that a large carrier who allows 6 mo. old drivers to become trainers often come in with their EOBR logs that are all messed up, ie both drivers on duty, wrong driver on duty ect. So I dont believe EOBRs will solve this problem.  That being said I do not believe that all companies should have to spend the money to buy and install these devises in their trucks.  I do agree that companies who can not operate in a safe manner should be forced to install these devises and but more importantly should be followed up with vigorously to insure compliance both in the back office and on the road.
2.  How about intergrating the federal system with all the state systems so when one of these carriers comes up to a scale they are flagged a checked on a more stringent basis.  Also make sure that they can not operate a prepass, this way they have to come thru the scales, these companies could also be checked at roadside inspections more often.

I find that people who rarely travel are the most confused by fees and services, expecting the 'good old days' of in-flight meals, movies, and free luggage. However, since I often get tickets online and use airlines with code-share agreements, fees across these agreements should be standardized, not individualized.

All OPTIONAL fees should be listed separately. These should be listed prominently on a travel web site, airline web site, ticket counter, and on the boarding pass. I can't remember how many times I've lost my receipt for baggage fees when trying to be reimbursed by my company for business travel, and to have to root through my wallet or purse for a tiny slip of paper is ridiculous.

Make all signs standard for each airline: you don't need to figure out where each menu item is listed at McDonald's -- they're all the same to make ordering easier for the customer.

1843,882,regroom_nomod,"I have lived my entire life with a peanut allergy; I carry emergency medicines with me at all times. In the past I have flown on planes serving peanut products and have been fine. I stopped flying on flights serving peanuts after having an asthma attack on a Southwest flight in 2007. It was not a life-threatening reaction but, to me, further exposure was not worth the risk. (In allergic individuals each allergen exposure results in a faster, more severe reaction the next time they come in contact with the allergen due to antibody production.) So far I have not relied on the government to keep me safe; I vote with my wallet and pay to fly on airlines that do not serve peanuts (i.e. American Airlines.) 

In response to what DOT wants to know:

1) I know that there are individuals who are more sensitive to peanut dust than I am. If it is at all likely that a single customer can suffer a  life-threatening reaction on an airplane, I believe peanuts should not be served because of that person. 
I cannot understand why all airlines do not voluntarily stop serving peanuts. Will it actually take someone dying mid-flight, (and the inevitable law suit,) to change peoples' minds? 
2) I believe that the risk posed by peanuts to a small percentage of the population warrants them not being served on airplanes. Air travel is a necessary part of modern living and cannot be avoided by those with allergies. I do not believe that airlines need - or should - carry epipens. The people best trained to use them are those with the allergy and presumably will have their own if the risk demands.
3) I cannot fathom why airlines would go through the trouble of carrying epipens (and training flight attendants to use them) just so they can continue to serve peanuts. What is so bad about pretzels after all? It seems as if some people believe that peanuts are the only thing that can be served on an airplane. 
4) I do not believe that foods which would release peanut dust into the air should be served. In my mind this includes packages of peanuts and peanut butter crackers. For simplicity's sake I would support a total peanut ban on airplanes but this may be impossible. Having read ingredient labels for my entire life, I am no longer surprised by the unlikely foods that contain peanuts.",Thank you for sharing your personal experience with peanut allergies and your concerns about airline passenger safety.

A similar problem, that should also be addressed, along with the peanut allergy problem, is the case of allowing small domestic pets in the cabin of a aircraft.

Additionally, many pet owners do not keep these animals in their carriers for the entire flight which increases the chance of exposure.

The substitution of cashews, walnuts, or other tree nuts is not a viable option, as they pose the same risks as peanuts.  A large number of people who are allergic to peanuts are also allergic to tree nuts, plus they are typically processed in a plant that also processes peanuts.  If there were a ban on peanut and tree nut products on flights, it would open the world to my son.  He didn't choose to be allergic, but he is.  I like the comment about not knowing anyone who would die if they DIDN'T have a peanut.  So true.  We are not talking about sensitivity, being offended, not liking the smell, etc.; we are talking about life.  There are a lot of things that are banned from airplanes that can cause death to someone.  In the case of my son, a peanut can have the same result.  I urge the DOT to issue the ban, and make traveling safe for everyone.","Thank you for sharing your personal experience and concerns about airline passenger safety.

Yes, you are fortunate.  For some people (my son) the life-threatening reaction of airway constriction is immediate.  I couldn't carry enough Epi-pens to allow the plane time enough to land so that we could get to an ER where a doctor--not a nurse--could save his life.  I'm not an expert like you, but last I heard death by suffocation takes a mere 9 minutes.  It would be good business for the airlines to voluntarily do everything they can to avoid re-directing aircraft due to an emergency and ruining everyone's very important trip to Cancun.  Perhaps they have contracts with Planter's?

Your concern about religious people requesting further bans on food reveals a lot about you. I'll quell your fears with this:  My son is not offended by peanuts nor do I have a book that says he shouldn't eat them; peanuts could kill him.  It is a scientifically proven fact that anaphylaxis exists and can kill after peanut exposure. Someone above likened this to the Boogey Man, but if I give my son a peanut, he could die (and almost has); everytime I look under his bed for the Boogey Man, there's nothing.  It's pretty reliable data.

Let life and death be the standard for what foods to ban, and no one should have a problem with this issue.  I didn't know that there was a sizable peanut lobby, nor that so many Americans tie their rights, freedom, and understanding of Capitalism to their ability to eat peanuts.  But I've always known that they love to tie their prejudices to matters they don't understand, and this board is proof of the reason WHY the government resorts to making laws that should be common sense and decency.","Thank you for sharing your personal experience and concerns about airline passenger rights.

After all is said and done I believe that creditors should have to prove that they have contacted the consumer before they are allowed to refer and debt to collection.  The debt collection system is rife with lack of due process in this aspect.  Secondly, I believe that if a debt has been referred to collection and the consumer has challenged the validity of the debt, then there is an obligation by the debt collection agency to act on and resolve the challenge.  There appears to be no such requirement currently since the same debts are getting rolled over to new collection agencies instead of being resolved.  The goal of debt collection should be to resolve contentious debt situations not merely to brow beat the consumer into submission.  Third, debt collection agencies need to stop the practice of disguising their collection notifications as junk mail with the intent of hoping the consumer will throw the correspondence away on first glance.  Debt collectors in my state routinely use return addresses from Mississippi and no accompanying postmark (using bulk mail designations from the post office just like junk mailings) knowing that if a consumer does not respond within 30 days of notification of a debt then all debt collection protections are essentially waived.  We need much more honesty and a level playing field in the debt collection industry.  We need a way to ensure that ALL parties involved in debt collection are sensible and forthright and above board.

I've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 (and I am now in my late 20s). By the age of 6, I knew how to take my medications myself. Since the EpiPen has come out, I've carried epinephrine with me. And I've always had various other medications - e.g. inhaler - on hand. I would never expect an airline to have such medications on hand, though I would expect them to have a first-aid kit.

Opponents of the ban suggest that allergy sufferers simply avoid flying. It might be possible when the sufferer is a child - perhaps it is possible for a family to drive to grandma's house for Christmas instead of taking a plane. This depends, of course, on where grandma lives - if she lives in California, and the family lives in Maine, there might be problems.

Adults, on the other hand, travel by air for a myriad of reasons. As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one. 

Towards the end of graduate school, I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them. For offices that were far away, I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city. I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air, but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication. I've had allergies since the age of 2, so I understand that sometimes, my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others. But when I take all necessary precautions and still, my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one, because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts, isn't that a little ridiculous? Is this really a fair result? I shudder to think what life will be like when I am a ""full-fledged"" working adult. Will I have to forgo promotions because I cannot travel on peanut-laden flights? It sounds dramatic, but it's not melodramatic. The only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights.","Thank you for sharing your personal experience as an adult with a peanut allergy.

Airlines (or travel agencies such as Travelocity) should be required to honor the offered price for at least some number of minutes - at least 10 minutes.

125,2082,regroom_nomod,"Bottom line...the new rules that the CFPB comes up with need to be FAIR to BOTH the debt collector and the consumer.   While there are collection agencies that abuse consumers and the system, and need to be dealt with, most agencies are simply trying to help collect monies due their clients from consumers who have chosen not to pay.  There could be a variety of reasons that they've chosen not to pay; both legit and not legit.

Currently, the playing field favors consumers; more specifically 'consumer attorneys'.  Collection agencies can get sued for leaving a message for a consumer WITHOUT disclosing that they owe a debt because uninformed judges have arbitrarily decided that a message that does not disclose any information about a debt is a communication.   This completely contradicts current FDCPA law, however, that specifically states that a 'communication' means directly conveying information regarding a debt. 

They can also get sued by leaving a 'Foti' message, should that message be overheard by a 3rd party.   'Foti' is NOT law, but rather another judge's uneducated (on FDCPA) opinion / ruling that basically states that 'messages need to give complete information about a consumer debt and that the call is from a collection agency, after allowing unrelated 3rd parties the opportunity to step away from the message retrieval device.  This sounds silly, but it's true.

Predatory consumer attorneys use this lack of definition in the law to perform 'Sue and Settle' techniques on collection agencies that make call attempts in one of the above stated procedures; agencies can get sued for trying to contact debtors by both methods.

What's worse, and I personally know consumers that this has happened to, is that these 'supposed' consumer attorneys aren't really acting on behalf of the consumers that they represent.  They use these consumers simply as a 'vehicle' to sue an agency where their whole goal is to get thousands of SETTLEMENT dollars in attorney fees as they can while only providing the alleged 'wronged' consumer several hundreds of dollars.  They use this 'SUE & SETTLE' business model as a way of extorting money from agencies because they know that an agency would have to spend $30-50K to defend themselves.  And, while the agency may be successful in defending themselves, many don't have the monies to spend defending themselves knowing that they cannot recoup these fees & costs from the consumer attorney that filed the frivolous lawsuit in the first place.

Furthermore, somewhere along the way, another uninformed judge made a ruling (NOT LAW) stating that agencies can be sued under TCPA by attempting to contact a consumer about their debt by an auto-dialer calling the consumer's cell phone.

Several things are wrong with this.  First, if you read the TCPA in it's entirety, it was meant to stop TELEPHONE SOLICITORS (people trying to sell consumers something), that didn't have any prior relationship with the consumer.  Collection agencies are not trying to sell anything.  Collection agencies, via BA Agreements, act as an extension of the business office for those creditors that DO HAVE A PRIOR RELATIONSHIP with consumers.  As such, the TCPA does not apply.  However, judges that are ignorant on the law make their opinion into a ruling which opens the doors for these predator attorneys to use their 'Sue & Settle' techniques. 

In conclusion, the CFPB needs to specifically define HOW collection agencies can lawfully contact, and work with, those consumers that owe their clients money.  The CFPB needs to 'throw out' ignorant rulings by judges who do not understand the law.

The laws have to be equal on both sides.  If not, the CFPB will simply provide consumers a legal avenue to steal from those businesses that they do credit business with by not paying their bills and, subsequently, these businesses not being able to hire debt collectors to help them get the money that they're owed.","Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the importance of fair rules for both debt collectors and consumers.

I would like to thank the DOT for having the courage to bring this matter up and to ask for comments from the public, especially after being told by Congress in 1998 to drop the matter or risk having funding removed. No doubt the peanut lobby played a major part in that directive.

Those who have legitimate life threatening allergies (and there are many) have a right to be heard. Unfortunately, there appear to be many who wish to snuff out these voices because certain rights may be impeded.

 Congress should listen to the doctors and scientists who study these disabilities and allow the experts to make their honest recommendations. I understand that the peanut lobby will probably want their say, but money should not outweigh logic and science.

I would prefer a total ban on peanut and tree nut foods being served on flights. 

My granddaughter has been medically diagnosed as having several allergies, including these two items. We are not hysterical, and we would be much happier if these allergies could disappear or be cured. Unfortunately, the science is not there yet. So, the family must all read labels, call companies when the labels are not clear, talk with restaurants, take ""safe"" food with us when no other solution is possible, and always carry a bag with any possibly required medications.

We are restricted from being able to take family vacations very far from home because of the negative attitudes of the airline companies, or lack of choices because of living next to a Delta hub.

The latest research indicates that peanut allergy doubled in children from 1997 to 2002 and that number continues to increase.   It is one of the most deadly food allergies.  

The presence of nuts on planes is a real fear.  While my kids have other potentially deadly food allergies, peanuts pose a unique risk.  Nuts break into fine pieces with dust that can become airborne.    Peanut butter is sticky and gets wiped on seats and tray tables.     Even the slightest microscopic amount of nuts can create an anaphylactic reaction.  

Although EpiPens can help, they are not 100% effective and should not be considered a solution to the risk peanuts pose to allergic individuals on planes.  Additional steroids, Benadryl shots, oxygen and other medical intervention may be necessary to stop an anaphylactic reaction.    EpiPens may need to be administered every 15 to 30 minutes as well.  People still die even with intervention.

We must understand that other governments may not view these rules as being benign and could very well impose restrictions on US carriers. Beware the law of unforeseen consequences.

The tarmac delay problem is not caused by airlines, and in particular foreign airlines. To submit them to significant operational or financial consequences because of something outside of their control doesn't seem appropriate.

Lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the FAA and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots. Eurocontrol (the FAA's equivalent) directs European airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport (or airspace) cannot provide it's expected capacity. When this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport.

1758,660,regroom_gen,There must be a complete ban on tree nuts and peanuts on planes.  It is a closed space. I am allergic to peanuts and almonds and I am impacted every time I fly.  A nut free zone does not work since the dust from nuts gets in the closed air system of the plane.  For the time that people are on planes there should be consideration of others who have no control as to the reactions they have to nuts.  For almost all other foods the allergy only occurs if the food is ingested so you can easily avoid the allergic reaction but not eating the food.  This is not true for many of us with nut allergies - we react if other people are eating the food since it is an airborne allergy.  I do fly but I have to take multiple Benadryl pills every 4 hours to keep from reacting to the airborne dust of the nuts.  This works for now but I always wonder when it will no longer be enough.  An epipen is not the answer as it lasts only look enough for the plane to land which is not a practical solution when you are flying on a long flight over water and would certainly be a much greater inconvenience to the other passengers than a ban on nut products on planes if the plane was able to land.  The rules airlines have are ridiculous - Southwest is not nut free they will not serve nuts but if you fly a late flight the peanuts are all over the floor and seats.  Some other airlines have the rows around you 'nut free' but advise you they can do nothing if the person seated next to you brings nuts on and wants to eat them.  Other airlines with advance notice will not serve nuts but all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts and will not stop the person from eating them if they wish to.  So you can have a 'nut free' flight and the person sitting next to you can take out their package of peanuts and eat away - and the airlines will do nothing to help you. Again all nuts should be banned from airplanes unless it is your own private plane - then go ahead and eat what you want. ,"Thank you for sharing your personal experience with nut allergies on planes.

1040,1252,regroom_prof,"I work @ sunset logistics in FT WORTH, TX. We are already using the EOBR but since we have a day and night crew, we are having to wait anywheres from 1 to 4 hours for an available truck just to log in to begin or daily HoS. The company says it is how it is done and we just have to ""suck it up"" as drivers and ""grow up"".
I have a friend that works for a major food supply chain that uses the EOBR and they have one in the drivers room to log in when you arrive to start your HoS.
I feel my company is abusing the rules by telling us we have to wait for a truck to log in and the wait time we use before logging in just doesn't count towards any on duty time. 
And if i run a paper log, which they absolutely hate for us to do, i will not have enough time to complete my loads for the day.
And for instance, one occasion i had a break down and my truck was broke down for several hours leaving me with exactly 5 hours of driving and on duty time left. When i finally got back to the yard, I was told to get in another truck, log into the peoplenet (EOBR) and i will have a full daily HoS to complete my run. 
I have asked the safety DEPT about this but got the usual ""i will look into it"" as he heads off to the break room....

In fact, in order to retain the right to take off, the airlines are required to load the plane and sit on the tarmac while the FAA figures out how to route traffic.

A nut free zone does not work since the dust from nuts gets in the closed air system of the plane.  For the time that people are on planes there should be consideration of others who have no control as to the reactions they have to nuts.  For almost all other foods the allergy only occurs if the food is ingested so you can easily avoid the allergic reaction but not eating the food.  This is not true for many of us with nut allergies - we react if other people are eating the food since it is an airborne allergy.  I do fly but I have to take multiple Benadryl pills every 4 hours to keep from reacting to the airborne dust of the nuts.  This works for now but I always wonder when it will no longer be enough.  An epipen is not the answer as it lasts only look enough for the plane to land which is not a practical solution when you are flying on a long flight over water and would certainly be a much greater inconvenience to the other passengers than a ban on nut products on planes if the plane was able to land.  The rules airlines have are ridiculous - Southwest is not nut free they will not serve nuts but if you fly a late flight the peanuts are all over the floor and seats.  Some other airlines have the rows around you 'nut free' but advise you they can do nothing if the person seated next to you brings nuts on and wants to eat them.  Other airlines with advance notice will not serve nuts but all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts and will not stop the person from eating them if they wish to.  So you can have a 'nut free' flight and the person sitting next to you can take out their package of peanuts and eat away - and the airlines will do nothing to help you.

DOT asked, ""How likely it is that a passenger with a severe peanut allergy will suffer a reaction from peanut particles in the air on a flight?""

I do, however, take issue with the phrasing of this question. Clearly, the genesis of the question is that allergic reactions to peanuts can be fatal. The question should address *potentially fatal* allergic reactions. This brings us to DOT's next question...

DOT asked: ""What steps should airlines have to take, if any, to avoid this danger?""
If the danger being addressed is any and all allergic peanut reaction, the answer is ""none."" If the danger being addressed is a *potentially fatal* allergic reaction, airlines should stop serving peanuts and contributing to a potentially dangerous environment. However, an outright restriction on what passengers may be permitted to bring on board is excessive and, potentially, unenforceable. Would gate agents be required to inspect passengers' snack items to ensure that they do not contain peanuts? Transportation security challenges are already too great to include enforcement of a ban on all peanut products. Furthermore, it is unreasonable to assume that the average citizen is fully aware of the peanut content (or made-in-a-factory-that-processes-peanuts labeling) of their snack items. No all-out ban will fully eliminate a potentially fatal environment, and DOT should not encourage such a false sense of security to those travelers who might be concerned about this matter.
If the study outlined in my first response yielded a reasonable ppm threshold of peanut particulate, DOT could work with airlines and airliner manufacturers to install the appropriate systems that would alert passengers to the risk as well as neutralize that risk.

DOT asked, ""Would an epinephrine auto-injector, to allow immediate treatment of an allergic reaction, be sufficient? If so, should it be the responsibility of the airline, or the passenger, to provide it?""
I cannot answer the first part. As for the second part, airlines already carry portable defibrilators. Carrying EpiPens would not be an undue burden. Airlines, however, should expect that passengers or parents would carry their own EpiPens. Airlines should not be expected to administer EpiPen treatments to unaccompanied children, and children with such allergies should not be permitted to fly unaccompanied.

DOT asked, ""Should any food item containing peanuts be covered in a restriction, including e.g., peanut butter crackers and products containing peanut oil?""
See above: airlines should not contribute to an environment that endangers their passengers. However, passenger choices should not be restricted, if reasonable assurance can be given that passenger food/snack choices do not contribute to a potentially fatal environment.","Thank you for your thoughtful and detailed comment on airline passenger rights. You've raised important points about the complexity of addressing peanut allergies on flights.

I typically fly Southwest Airlines - a leading airline in distributing peanuts to passengers as THE ONLY SNACK on many of their flights.  After a typical flight, I will have itchy, watery eyes sometimes to the point where I can barely keep my eyes open.  Luckily my allergy is not AS BAD as many - but I can empathize with those with worse conditions.

Although I am not against the idea of peanuts being restricted from all flights, I do appreciate people's comments regarding the absurdity of such an all-encompassing rule.  I think an effective and simple solution might be to ask passengers either verbally when tickets are purchased person-to-person, or via a question prior to an e-ticket purchase that asks the traveler if they are allergic to peanuts.  If yes - then that particular flight can be aired out of prior peanuts and peanuts not served on that flight.  I look forward to seeing the outcome to this issue.","Thank you for your comment.

airlines and airports should tell the truth, the whole truth, and treat their CUSTOMERS with respect!  if unpredictable situations arise, well-informed CUSTOMERS who are treated with respect will, most of the time, respond accordingly.  as far as i can tell, airlines are not legally liable for anything any more; delays, cancellations, etc. are always blamed on the weather now and CUSTOMERS, when finally untethered from their seats, are finally freed with an attitude of  ""don't let the door hit you on your way out.""
airports and airlines should have contingency plans which clearly separate their responsibilities, so that each knows what it must provide when accommodating CUSTOMERS in a crisis.
yes, international CUSTOMERS should not be subjected to more stress and inconvenience by being kept on the plane any longer than normal flight time.  why would CUSTOMERS be kept in their tiny seat spaces any longer than necessary when a separate area in the terminal would be so amenable, provided proper services are available?  this would be very human, and kind, the kind of thing a company should want to provide for its CUSTOMERS.
as for delays, this depends on the projected duration of delay.  the three-hour limit should have no bearing.  if the delay is more than one hour, CUSTOMERS should be allowed off.  BUT!  it should be made crystal clear to anyone who deplanes that it is his/her responsibility to get back before the plane departs.  NO IFS ANDS OR BUTS.  airlines should exert some backbone and make this stick and CUSTOMERS will admire and appreciate them for it. this will add to the delay, as baggage will have to be removed, but soon enough the problem will be minimal.

Should DOT require that carriers give priority kiosk access to travelers with disabilities? DOT worries that if travelers without disabilities can use accessible (as well as nonaccessible) kiosks, travelers with disabilities may wait longer than average because they need one of a limited number of machines. But reserving accessible kiosks for travelers with disabilities, or giving them priority access, could segregate and stigmatize them.  What is the best resolution of this dilemma?

My response:

The best resolution would be to roll out accessible kiosks in the lines reserved for priority/elite/premium class passengers.  This would best reduce disabled users' wait times (since airlines work to make these lines short), are in a location identifiable in another way, and will ensure that disabled priority/elite/premium class passengers have access to accessible kiosks.  While this will stigmatize some disabled passengers, it seems the best interim solution until the goal of 100% accessibility is achieved.

1) Airlines do not serve peanuts on-board
2) All airlines have a well-documented, easily accessible, and ingrained among all flight staff policy regarding food allergies and procedures for dealing with food allergies, including:
a) Early boarding for passengers with allergies to inspect their assigned seats and either clean them or request a seat change if necessary (Southwest allows early boarding as long as you do not take an exit row) 
2) Following declaration of an allergy, education of nearby passengers regarding peanut products (particularly those which may release dust that can go airborne); this could be done with a single-sided piece of paper.
3) Flexibility with seating assignments to accommodate changes if a problem is apparent.

Essentially, the key with this, as with everything in life, is to minimize risk while maximizing feasibility.  An absolute ban on peanut products is not currently possible, but it is possible to increase the protection of passengers with life threatening allergies with minimal inconvenience to other passengers.

Anaphylaxis can happen much more readily for him by the transfer of oils (peanut oils on airline tray tables, arm rests). It can also happen by airborne dust.  In a flight where peanuts are being served and all 100+ bags go POOF at the same time they are opened - well, let's just say it would be a mother's nightmare.  Especialy with recycled cabin air.  Even without a peanut allergy, peanuts are just such a choking hazard for any small children.  Why serve them?  There are plenty of reasonable alternatives.  I recall when my son was first diagnosed, 1 week prior to Christmas.  Our pediatrician called us at all of our nighttime emergency numbers just to ensure we wouldn't step onto any holiday airline flights without an epi-pen and proper documentation of his condition.  I was FLOORED to f sind out that Delta still served peanuts.  Really??  Peanut allergy is unlike some other food allergies in that there are multiple ways to have reaction (ingestion, touching, breathing).  My suggestion would be to ban peanut products on all airlines.  But that still does not/will  not control what snacks others bring on.  So I would suggest they still offer peanut free buffer zones and have some method of ensuring passengers in those rows are aware of what that means (don't bring or open peanut snacks). I also think that pre-boarding should be an option, so that peanut families can go and wipe down the tray tables/arm rests themselves and feel comfortable with the environment in which their child will be sitting. I've been on one too many flights were peanuts have been banned simply due to an allergic person flying...and I feel SO MUCH sympathy for those families, because the airline staff does not seem to be good at respecting their privacy. In fact, they almost act begruding or point out the poor child to other.  What kid wants to be labeled?  In all honesty, I can't see making the switch to peanut free snacks to be that big an impact to the airlines. As long as items are clearly labeled (most, not all pretzels) are o.k.

680,635,regroom_prof,"I have one child who is severely allergic to peanuts.  She is one of those few who react from dust, practically.  We made a decision at an early age simply not to fly.  The airlines have no cohesive, consistent policy and this issue is not something we can show up and be surprised about.

It would help children, and adults, like my daughter if the DOT banned peanuts on all flights.  Of course, asking airlines to stop serving peanuts is not enough.  The DOT would need to require that no passenger bring them aboard as well.  Let's face it, cuts to the airlines have put food at the bottom of their priority list (hence handing out ""snacks"" like peanuts).  So...if you will be flying for hours and have little prospect for food, what is the perfect protein packed food you can bring that needs no refrigeration?

I almost feel like banning peanuts would give people a false sense of security UNLESS a complete and total ban was instituted (airline & passengers).

That being said, I appreciate the argument about other allergies, as well as perfume (though I do not believe anaphylaxis is generally an issue for those allergic to perfume).  Why do we need food on board at all?  Perhaps that is a bit naive and narrow-minded, but how about a drinks-only rule?  Do 1 or 2 hours flights really need to serve ANY kind of food?  Propose that to the airlines as a cost saving measure!  (Of course, longer flights or international is a whole other ballgame.)

So, to answer the DOT questions over there <---- I would say:

1.  From empirical evidence, I believe there is a strong likelihood of a peanut allergy sufferer having a severe reaction if the conditions were right.  My daughter developed hives from peanut shell residue that had touched a banana peel.  She touched the peel to her skin and broke out in hives.  It doesn't take much.

2.  I feel strongly that people should take responsibility for themselves and, therefore, would expect all allergy sufferers to carry their own epinephrine.  However, I am under the assumption that a plane would have first aid available and possibly a defibrillator.  Adding epinephrine to this kit would only be a good business practice.

3.  I would feel (relatively) safe on a plane where peanut-ingredient products are banned from airline and passengers, but ""may contains"" were permitted.  My allergic daughter would not consume them, but the chance of her having a reaction from cross contact or inhalation are virtually nil.  Again, it's about personal responsibility.  We will take care of her food.  We just need help keeping her alive and safe from other peoples food.

tarmac delay rules should apply to every flight; EVERY FLIGHT!  the CUSTOMERS who must exit or who need aid should be SERVED regardless of the size of the plane, its origination, or its destination.
airlines and airports should tell the truth, the whole truth, and treat their CUSTOMERS with respect!  if unpredictable situations arise, well-informed CUSTOMERS who are treated with respect will, most of the time, respond accordingly.  as far as i can tell, airlines are not legally liable for anything any more; delays, cancellations, etc. are always blamed on the weather now and CUSTOMERS, when finally untethered from their seats, are finally freed with an attitude of  ""don't let the door hit you on your way out.""
airports and airlines should have contingency plans which clearly separate their responsibilities, so that each knows what it must provide when accommodating CUSTOMERS in a crisis.
yes, international CUSTOMERS should not be subjected to more stress and inconvenience by being kept on the plane any longer than normal flight time.  why would CUSTOMERS be kept in their tiny seat spaces any longer than necessary when a separate area in the terminal would be so amenable, provided proper services are available?  this would be very human, and kind, the kind of thing a company should want to provide for its CUSTOMERS.
as for delays, this depends on the projected duration of delay.  the three-hour limit should have no bearing.  if the delay is more than one hour, CUSTOMERS should be allowed off.  BUT!  it should be made crystal clear to anyone who deplanes that it is his/her responsibility to get back before the plane departs.

How about this. When I work 5 hours BEFORE I start driving because that is what is necessary to keep my job and then I drive 10 or 11 hours following, how will law enforcement know I worked that 5 hours before I started driving.

I would like to thank the DOT for having the courage to bring this matter up and to ask for comments from the public, especially after being told by Congress in 1998 to drop the matter or risk having funding removed. No doubt the peanut lobby played a major part in that directive.

Those who have legitimate life threatening allergies (and there are many) have a right to be heard. Unfortunately, there appear to be many who wish to snuff out these voices because certain rights may be impeded.

 Congress should listen to the doctors and scientists who study these disabilities and allow the experts to make their honest recommendations. I understand that the peanut lobby will probably want their say, but money should not outweigh logic and science.

I would prefer a total ban on peanut and tree nut foods being served on flights. 

My granddaughter has been medically diagnosed as having several allergies, including these two items. We are not hysterical, and we would be much happier if these allergies could disappear or be cured. Unfortunately, the science is not there yet. So, the family must all read labels, call companies when the labels are not clear, talk with restaurants, take ""safe"" food with us when no other solution is possible, and always carry a bag with any possibly required medications. We accept these as our responsibility.

We are restricted from being able to take family vacations very far from home because of the negative attitudes of the airline companies, or lack of choices because of living next to a Delta hub. This does not affect one person, this affects 12! I would have thought that the airlines would have taken this into account when looking at their bottom dollar, but Delta has stated that they will not restrict peanuts because their home is in Georgia! 

The negative comments from some of the writers posted here are not helpful in defining what is the correct solution to allow allergy sufferers, and their families, to fly.

40,675,regroom_gen,"  Well said.  I fly extensively in the US and internationally.  And, in reading all the comments posted thus far, for the most part, there appears to be a lot of emotion and not a lot of facts surrounding this issue. 
   The airlines should not be banning any food and they certainly should not be come the food police.  
  I strongly urge the DOT to get more scientic-based information.  Any disability needs to be treated with sensitivity. However, i want to point out that when we installed ramps for those in a wheel chairs, we did not remove the stairs.  
  Some facts to consider.  studies show that you cannot have a serious/deadly reaction to peanut, tree nut,  or other food allergy protein by smelling it; despite what some of the contributors here have said.  Less than 1% of the population has a peanut allergy and not all of those are ""severly"" allergic. (Compare that with the exponentially higher incidence of diabetes--diabetics need plant based proteins like peanuts during flights to keep their blood sugar levels under control.) or, a milk allergy which is far more prevelent.
  Airborne exposure will not affect the body systemically, so therefore cannot cause anaphylaxis. If extremely allergic, you may have some symptoms like sneezing, running nose and coughing. For those peanut or tree nut allergic, and for all food allergies, you MUST ingest the food protein to have a systemtic reaction. And, even with direct skin contact to tree nuts, peanuts or peanut and nut butters, most allergic people will not show signs of a reaction, or it so it will be a localized minor one such as hives, or a welt.  
   You can, however, have a psyhcosomatic reaction to anything you are afraid of.  Peanut allergy has become an exaggerated fear to the detriment of those who suffer from other food allergies and other serious and chronic diseases.
   A few Facts:  more than 3,000 kids die from asthma each year; 10,000 kids go to the hospital each year with brain injuries due to sports; 45,000 kids die in car accidents. Last time i saw a statisic on food allergy fatalities it was aobut 100 to 150 over a five year period for all foods.  This is not to say that peanut and tree nut allergies, or any allergy is not serious. They are.
  But I wonder if these same parents who are demandting that peanuts and tree nuts be banned from everywhere are asking for sports be eliminated from school programs, or if their children are being kept out of sports. or, have they given up driving their children in a car; or, will they get their son or daughter a drivers license at age 16.  
  i have a friend whose child almost died twice from a serious allergy to milk because people think milk allergy can't be fatal; they confuse milk allergy with lactose intolerance because the hysteria created by some about peanut has drowned out any sense of reason and overshadowed everyone else's issues.  A recent widely publicized study showed that far more people think they have food allergies than actually do. Again, i am not minimizing those who do, but a food allergy needs to be diagnosed by a certified immunologist who conducts a food challenge. Then and only then does a patient really know what they are allergic to. and, a food allergy is very different than a food sensitivity.   Many people have multiple food allergies, but once properly diagnosed that person needs to be taught to care for themselves and take all necessary precautions.
   Also, I read in the news is that patients with egg and food allergy have now been de-sensitized in clinical settings with guess what?  egg and peanut!  so, let's rid ourselves of the hysteria.  let's stop our demanding and outrageousness and let's call for ome common sense.  i fear for these children that are being raised by parents to live in fear of the ""bogey man"".  instead of teaching them to handle whatever afflication they have in a responsible and calm manner--whether it's severe asthma, other food allergies, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and the hundreds of other afflications that so many of us live with everyday.  
   I myself have a food allergy so i truly understand what it takes to be vigliant; it isn't easy.  
   in all my years of flying and with all the different carriers i have been on, i find that whether in the US or abroad, without legislation, they try to be as accommodating as possible when people plan ahead and are not behaving rudely.
   we have more than enough regulation and every time a new regulation comes along it always carries unintended consequences.  so, once you ban peanuts and tree nuts, will you prohibit seeing eye dogs on flights for those of us who are severly allergic?  Remember, you can die from an asthma attack caused by a reaction to an animal. or, will you have a voice of reason and talk with the carrier, check on your medications, where a highly refined mask and take the right precautions.  
   My own near fatal experience to a different allergy reinforced for me that if you demand the world conform to you, you will become lax making it more likely you will have an accidenta encounter.  we need to be prepared and proactive, not create a bubble around ourselves and our children.

When my husband called the next day she said they couldn't offer a refund because I had already made a change.  The refund was never offered to me or I would have taken it.  A refund should be automatic when the airline changes your flight on you.","Thanks KT1975 for the interesting comment.

Yes, you are fortunate.  For some people (my son) the life-threatening reaction of airway constriction is immediate.  I couldn't carry enough Epi-pens to allow the plane time enough to land so that we could get to an ER where a doctor--not a nurse--could save his life.  I'm not an expert like you, but last I heard death by suffocation takes a mere 9 minutes.  It would be good business for the airlines to voluntarily do everything they can to avoid re-directing aircraft due to an emergency and ruining everyone's very important trip to Cancun.  Perhaps they have contracts with Planter's?

Your concern about religious people requesting further bans on food reveals a lot about you. I'll quell your fears with this:  My son is not offended by peanuts nor do I have a book that says he shouldn't eat them; peanuts could kill him.  It is a scientifically proven fact that anaphylaxis exists and can kill after peanut exposure. Someone above likened this to the Boogey Man, but if I give my son a peanut, he could die (and almost has); everytime I look under his bed for the Boogey Man, there's nothing.  It's pretty reliable data.

Let life and death be the standard for what foods to ban, and no one should have a problem with this issue.  I didn't know that there was a sizable peanut lobby, nor that so many Americans tie their rights, freedom, and understanding of Capitalism to their ability to eat peanuts.  But I've always known that they love to tie their prejudices to matters they don't understand, and this board is proof of the reason WHY the government resorts to making laws that should be common sense and decency.","Computer_Forensics_Expert and Immunoglobulin, thank you for your comments.

1315,638,regroom_prof,"The airlines/DOT should absolutely adopt a blanket policy concerning severe food allergies to peanuts but not limit it to that, I would like to see it extended to tree nuts. Many people/children who are allergic to 1 are generally allergic to the other. The policy should be adopted because severe food allergies is a disability in the eyes of the ADA (Americans with Disabilites Act) A person who cannot perform one of lifes major functions definition: 
Major life activity"" means functions such as: caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and/or working.

A severe allergic reaction includes anaphylaxis..the major function here the person cannot perform is breathing.

I have an allergic child who can have3 a severe reaction to tree nuts/peanuts & we have seen her go into anaphylactic shock from minimal exposure to allergens & have seen her react to contact..touching a contaminated surface then touching her own skin/face.

We have flown SOuthwest & Jet Blue, both very accommodating..JB more than SW are so knowledgeable, know what snacks to remove & what ingredients to look for.  They also make an announcement to request passengers refrain from eating their own snacks because of an allergic passenger..and they are good about respecting privacy. SW removes snacks & allows preboard to wipe down seats, etc., but no announcement. They do have an alternative snack ready & know ahead of time that there will be a PA child on board as our itinerary gets double noted..online & follow up phone call. JB also allows preboard so we can clean, they even offer their own anti bac wipes.  I have heard horror stories about Delta who will only provied a buffer zone which is no help if the allergy is airborne or contact. We bring our own emergency meds which is only good for 20 min. An airline should have EpiPen & EpiPen jr on board in case there is 1st time exposure & should be trained to use them, it is not didfficult. Most will bring their own.","Thanks for all of the information regarding your experiences on JB and SW.

360,650,regroom_prof,"Hello and thank you for the opportunity to provide input on air travel procedures.  As someone that once logged 100+ flights per year for many years, I have experienced both the best and the worst of what air travel can provide.

I would like to offer some insights that hopefully will expand the scope of the regulation you are considering vis-à-vis airline-passenger communication.  From a passenger perspective, I believe there are actually three deficiencies that drive the current communication problem, and resulting shortcomings in the system:  (1) There is a major disconnect in information between gate agents and reservation agents; (2) There is no prompt communication between the airline and the passenger (as you correctly note here); and (3) There is no way to guarantee re-booking or re-routing, without penalty, without going to the airport.  As a result, even when there is a high likelihood that a flight will be canceled, passengers go to the airport, often at significant expense, then must wait in long lines, causing havoc inside the airport, and creating the inefficient system that we are all familiar with.  I believe these three together are the source of the problem and would like to illustrate this with a brief example:

This winter, I had a vacation booked to Colorado to ski.  On the day of travel there was heavy snow in New York City.  To me it was obvious that my flight would be canceled.  However, despite repeated calls to the airline, I was assured that the flight was showing to depart on-time (Problems 1 and 2).  However, knowing that if the flight did leave, even if that were 5 hours later, I would face a steep re-booking expense (change fee plus fare difference!), I went to the airport regardless (Problem 3).  Upon arrival at the airport, and after checking my skis curbside, my fears were of course confirmed, the flight had been canceled, and there were long lines at all of the agent counters and the gates.  I then waited in line for an hour, re-booked, waited another hour to collect my bag, and returned home.  The monetary expense for me was $150 in cab rides and tips, and 5 hours in time, and one day of lost skiing.  None of which was claimable/reimbursable.

So, I would like to suggest oversight/regulation of the following:  (1) Airlines should be required to invest in systems that streamline information so that information among their reservations agents is as current as it is at the gate; (2) In addition to notifying passengers about their flight promptly (30 minutes sounds reasonable), there should be earlier, and more frequent communication about overall ""Airport Health"" on the day of travel.  For example, just letting a passenger know about his/her flight in advance does not necessarily help at all.  If that communication comes less than 90 minutes before departure, it is outside of the window in which a passenger can react:  he/she is already on the way to the airport.  However, if an earlier communication were:  ""Due to heavy snow, all flights this morning have been departing 1-2 hours behind schedule.  Please prepare for delays/possibility of cancellation.  We will provide another status update in one hour.""  This is a communication that a passenger can thoughtfully incorporate into his/her planning.  Finally, (3) Rules should be developed defining the conditions under which a passenger can rebook without charge.  Perhaps if the flight is going to be delayed more than 3 hours, it is better for the passenger and the airline to let a passenger rebook.  Sometimes the flight is overbooked anyway.

I believe further consideration of the above collectively would result in a far better passenger experience, and more efficient airline management.  Thank you for considering my input.  RK","Thanks for your thoughts Keiserrgx.

One question DOT asks is what method carriers should use for their updates. Since it seems you fly often, how would you like to receive information updates? Do you think all carriers should use a single method?

1863,675,regroom_prof,"  Well said.  I fly extensively in the US and internationally.  And, in reading all the comments posted thus far, for the most part, there appears to be a lot of emotion and not a lot of facts surrounding this issue. 
   The airlines should not be banning any food and they certainly should not be come the food police.  
  I strongly urge the DOT to get more scientic-based information.  Any disability needs to be treated with sensitivity. However, i want to point out that when we installed ramps for those in a wheel chairs, we did not remove the stairs.  
  Some facts to consider.  studies show that you cannot have a serious/deadly reaction to peanut, tree nut,  or other food allergy protein by smelling it; despite what some of the contributors here have said.  Less than 1% of the population has a peanut allergy and not all of those are ""severly"" allergic. (Compare that with the exponentially higher incidence of diabetes--diabetics need plant based proteins like peanuts during flights to keep their blood sugar levels under control.) or, a milk allergy which is far more prevelent.
  Airborne exposure will not affect the body systemically, so therefore cannot cause anaphylaxis. If extremely allergic, you may have some symptoms like sneezing, running nose and coughing. For those peanut or tree nut allergic, and for all food allergies, you MUST ingest the food protein to have a systemtic reaction. And, even with direct skin contact to tree nuts, peanuts or peanut and nut butters, most allergic people will not show signs of a reaction, or it so it will be a localized minor one such as hives, or a welt.  
   You can, however, have a psyhcosomatic reaction to anything you are afraid of.  Peanut allergy has become an exaggerated fear to the detriment of those who suffer from other food allergies and other serious and chronic diseases.
   A few Facts:  more than 3,000 kids die from asthma each year; 10,000 kids go to the hospital each year with brain injuries due to sports; 45,000 kids die in car accidents. Last time i saw a statisic on food allergy fatalities it was aobut 100 to 150 over a five year period for all foods.  This is not to say that peanut and tree nut allergies, or any allergy is not serious. They are.
  But I wonder if these same parents who are demandting that peanuts and tree nuts be banned from everywhere are asking for sports be eliminated from school programs, or if their children are being kept out of sports. or, have they given up driving their children in a car; or, will they get their son or daughter a drivers license at age 16.  
  i have a friend whose child almost died twice from a serious allergy to milk because people think milk allergy can't be fatal; they confuse milk allergy with lactose intolerance because the hysteria created by some about peanut has drowned out any sense of reason and overshadowed everyone else's issues.  A recent widely publicized study showed that far more people think they have food allergies than actually do. Again, i am not minimizing those who do, but a food allergy needs to be diagnosed by a certified immunologist who conducts a food challenge. Then and only then does a patient really know what they are allergic to. and, a food allergy is very different than a food sensitivity.   Many people have multiple food allergies, but once properly diagnosed that person needs to be taught to care for themselves and take all necessary precautions.
   Also, I read in the news is that patients with egg and food allergy have now been de-sensitized in clinical settings with guess what?  egg and peanut!  so, let's rid ourselves of the hysteria.  let's stop our demanding and outrageousness and let's call for ome common sense.  i fear for these children that are being raised by parents to live in fear of the ""bogey man"".  instead of teaching them to handle whatever afflication they have in a responsible and calm manner--whether it's severe asthma, other food allergies, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and the hundreds of other afflications that so many of us live with everyday.  
   I myself have a food allergy so i truly understand what it takes to be vigliant; it isn't easy.  
   in all my years of flying and with all the different carriers i have been on, i find that whether in the US or abroad, without legislation, they try to be as accommodating as possible when people plan ahead and are not behaving rudely.
   we have more than enough regulation and every time a new regulation comes along it always carries unintended consequences.  so, once you ban peanuts and tree nuts, will you prohibit seeing eye dogs on flights for those of us who are severly allergic?  Remember, you can die from an asthma attack caused by a reaction to an animal. or, will you have a voice of reason and talk with the carrier, check on your medications, where a highly refined mask and take the right precautions.  
   My own near fatal experience to a different allergy reinforced for me that if you demand the world conform to you, you will become lax making it more likely you will have an accidenta encounter.  we need to be prepared and proactive, not create a bubble around ourselves and our children.

750,667,regroom_prof,"As a frequent traveler and the mom of a 23 year old with multiple food allergies, I understand how complicated this type of rule making can be.  The ""rights"" of the peanut allergy sufferer are in direct conflict with the ""rights"" of the passengers that want to eat peanuts.  For many years we avoided the conflict by traveling throughout the U.S. via motorhome.  This is not a reasonalbe option for everyone since it can be very time consuming vs. flying. 
Now that my son is older and interested in traveling to Europe, we can't reasonably get there via motorhome.  We choose our airlines carefully, carry multiple Epi-pens, pack his food from home, and I pray.
It's a very scary propostion being 35,000 feet in the air over the open ocean, knowing that each Epi-pen is effective for approximately 10-15 minutes.  My son tries to sleep most of the flight and fortunately has a much larger bladder than I do.  He gets a window seat and one of us acts as his buffer to the food cart.
This is a scary and risky proposition with a 23 year old who can quickly determine his own symptoms. It would be even scarier with a young child.
The problem with peanuts and tree nuts is that they are dry and flaky so can readily become airborne.  Their oils are sticky and stubborn so can endure through a vigorous scrub with soap and water.
My son is also allergic to milk and eggs. Nobody talks about banning them because they don't have the above mentioned properties of peanuts and tree nuts.
Traveling the world is an envigorating and enlightening experience that many would argue is as important as the structured education that we experience from 12-16+ years. Many people have to travel for work and others are required to relocate to keep their employment.
Back to the question of your rights or mine.  I prefer to live in an educated, enlightened, fulfilled, and respectful society. 
If my donut is going to set off your diabetes, I will gladly forgo the donut for six to twelve to twenty four hours.  I can live without it.
Everyone can live without peanuts and tree nuts.  So let's be reasonable and let all safely travel.  Ban the nuts and see how many more families get onboard.  Airline revenues will probably go up and that's a good thing.
BTW, I've been in 6 countries in the last 6 months, so I consider myself a frequent flyer.
