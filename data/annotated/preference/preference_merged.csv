You know what would happen..the customer would get their lawyer or go to the better business bureau or TV station and cry foul. 
So, why do we put up with airlines telling us, Sorry we are oversold? As if they can not keep track on their computers. We all know it is a gamble on their part to hope we do not show up and they can sell the seat twice.
Stop the practice now. It does not have to continue. There is no reason except for greed of the airlines. We know it does not keep ticket prices low. That is not the reason for doing it. If I sell a customer something and they do not take the item - I am ahead,
I still have their money. The same with the seat issue.","Thank you for sharing your perspective on airline passenger rights. It's interesting to draw parallels between retail and airline industries.

Ingestion or contact can trigger severe reactions. 

Take peanuts and items containing peanuts/peanut butter (e.g., trail mix, peanut butter crackers) off of airplanes. This is all the airlines need to do. Most airlines already have a suitable replacement snack.

Anyone with a severe allergy already has EpiPens or other medications. Airlines need not provide these.

If we are serious about safety EOBR's should be mandatory on all vehicles. As far as productivity is concerned, a lot of products in america are moved with little notice and require trucks at a moments notice as opposed to freight that ships on a continual basis. I think this is what sets America apart from other countries because we can ship anything, anywhere very quickly. many times to move this type of freight quickly you can't comply with the current HOS but that doesn't mean you are endangering other people on the road.

6656d29cb8a73166ffdad20d,64,756,"Reading most of the comments it seems that the biggest concern is peanut allergy sufferers inhaling peanut particles. Perhaps instead of banning peanuts and peanut products outright. Airlines and the DOT can provide sufferers with HEPA airmasks which I assume will prevent individuals from inhaling peanut dust. I would think this approach would be of minimal cost (air filters can be bought for about $20 or less) and would not require a ban. If touch is a problem dressing accordingly (i.e. long clothes for the trip to minimize touching surfaces)can help decrease the amount. 
I would say that if someone still insists upon a ban if these measures would work that we are then getting into a debate of my rights over your rights and my want to be comfortable compared to your want to be comfortable which definitely takes us out of the need to protect life arena

6656d29cb8a73166ffdad20d,84,639,"I have a young son who is beyond Class 6 (highest class)for peanuts/tree nuts. For him, it simply is not a matter of ""passing up"" on a snack.  Anaphylaxis can happen much more readily for him by the transfer of oils (peanut oils on airline tray tables, arm rests). It can also happen by airborne dust.  In a flight where peanuts are being served and all 100+ bags go POOF at the same time they are opened - well, let's just say it would be a mother's nightmare.  Especialy with recycled cabin air.  Even without a peanut allergy, peanuts are just such a choking hazard for any small children.  Why serve them?  There are plenty of reasonable alternatives.  I recall when my son was first diagnosed, 1 week prior to Christmas.  Our pediatrician called us at all of our nighttime emergency numbers just to ensure we wouldn't step onto any holiday airline flights without an epi-pen and proper documentation of his condition.  I was FLOORED to f sind out that Delta still served peanuts.  Really??  Peanut allergy is unlike some other food allergies in that there are multiple ways to have reaction (ingestion, touching, breathing).  My suggestion would be to ban peanut products on all airlines.  But that still does not/will  not control what snacks others bring on.  So I would suggest they still offer peanut free buffer zones and have some method of ensuring passengers in those rows are aware of what that means (don't bring or open peanut snacks). I also think that pre-boarding should be an option, so that peanut families can go and wipe down the tray tables/arm rests themselves and feel comfortable with the environment in which their child will be sitting. I've been on one too many flights were peanuts have been banned simply due to an allergic person flying...and I feel SO MUCH sympathy for those families, because the airline staff does not seem to be good at respecting their privacy. In fact, they almost act begruding or point out the poor child to other.  What kid wants to be labeled?  In all honesty, I can't see making the switch to peanut free snacks to be that big an impact to the airlines. As long as items are clearly labeled (most, not all pretzels) are o.k.  If nothing else, I am so very appreciative that this issue is gaining attention.  I don't think airlines realize how many passengers don't fly them due to their poor policies. In fact, I learned so much already today reading these message boards. I will make it a point to frequent the airlines (that serve my area) where people seem to have had really positive and supportive environments when flying with their children.  Great info for me to have as a parent.   I also wonder if you couldn't look into how the major sports arenas handle peanut allergies.  Most will offer at least one ""peanut free"" day so that children can enjoy major league sports like baseball etc.  So it can be done.  And they have WAY more people in one arena than on a single flight.  Thanks again for allowing us to share our thoughts!!","Welcome to Regulation Room and thanks for your comment!

6656d29cb8a73166ffdad20d,1,771,"I think baggage fees especially should be included in the price of the ticket.  And all other relevant fees.  It is not particularly important to include snacks but anything else that is essential to the flight should be included.  Also, as others have stated, there needs to be better control of what passengers are allowed to carry-on.  I am to the point where if I don't have to fly I won't because it has become such a zoo with people trying to cram oversized, so-called carryon bags into other peoples' space.  Also, when they are stopped at the gate with an oversized ""carry-on"" they should be charged a fee to check it if the rest of us have paid a baggage check fee.  

""Significant fees"" should be defined as those charged for something that is an essential part of the flight, i.e. seating, baggage, fuel, and I guess some airlines are considering charging for the use of overhead space and bathrooms.

6656d29cb8a73166ffdad20d,94,768,"Let them overbook, but make it painful if they deny boarding.  The suggested penalties are not strong enough.   The penalty should apply to all ticket holders except for company employees traveling on free tickets as part of their job.  

First and foremost, whatever the penalty it must be paid in check or credit to a credit card immediately at the gate.  No more vouchers, which tend to be be worthless because of the airlines travel rules and restrictions.  

The starting point for the penalty should be the full fare cost of the ticket in whatever class the original ticket was issued.  So full Y, B, or F fare; no discount.  It should include all fees and taxes that would apply to the ticket if purchased by the consumer.  (This gets DOT out of the business of determining the value and worrying about inflation adjusted costs; the airline has already done the computation of the value of the ticket.)  The consumer should also be booked at the airlines expense on the next available flight in the same class as the original ticket.  

For every subsequent denied boarding for the consumer, they should get the same amount as the original payment to thus encourage the airline to get the passenger to their destination.

Airlines should not be allowed to offer any reduction to this penalty but could offer more in order to get passengers to deplane.  Vouchers do not count; only cash incentives should be allowed.

The penalty should apply to any size commercial flight whether it be five, ten, or 300 seats.  

Only when the penalty for over booking is truly onerous will the airlines stop this despicable practice.  I have no sympathy for the airline as 90% of the tickets they sell are non-refundable and non-cancelable; so they cannot be used and the airline gets its money. 

As to the argument that costs will increase, etc., then let the airlines sell a standby ticket which is not subject to these rules and penalties and let the consumer decide if they want to take the risk.  However, knowing how the airlines work, no more than 5% of all tickets sold nor more than 5% of total seat capacity of the flight (whichever is less) should be permitted to be sold in this special category (otherwise they would immediately sell all their seats like this to avoid the penalties.)  

Good luck.  I don't envy you up against the lawyers the airlines have on their payroll to say nothing of the pressure the airlines will exert on congress to get this watered down.

If you increase their costs, they either have to reduce their overbooking or pay the extra fees. Either which way, they will lose more money than they already are losing.

Higher fares, even higher change ticket fees (or stop allowing change tickets altogether and if you miss the flight, oh well), airlines going out of business (less competition & more unemployment).

6656d29cb8a73166ffdad20d,79,735,"I disagree.  The ""rights"" debate is not a good perspective in this context.  As used by opponents of accommodations, it is an inflammatory bandwagon fallacy that simply appeals to an ideologically-motivated distrust of government and regulation in any case whatsoever.  Even if ""rights"" was a good perspective, still, there are always competing rights to resolve.  In this case, the equal right to travel safely trumps the right to eat a bag of peanuts.  

The simple reality is that peanuts have become – for reasons not thoroughly understood – a potentially fatal allergen for a growing number of Americans.  There problem will get worse before it gets better, as studies indicate that prevalence has tripled among children in recent years.  Unless accommodations are made, this will represent lost income for airlines.  

There does not need to be a death record to make this decision.  What sort of standard is that?  Put the onus on the peanut industry to finalize the non-allergenic peanut, not on those suffering life-threatening peanut allergies to ante up a few more deaths.  

This executive/administrative decision is so simple, it's absurd.  Discontinue service of peanuts on airlines.

Having said that, how exactly would such a ban on peanuts be enforced? I was on a Southwest flight not long ago, where a mom demanded that peanuts not be served on her flight with her daughter. The flight attendants complied. Mind you, this was Southwest Airlines, which had the marketing tagline ""We Fly For Peanuts"" for years. Common sense dictates that if your daughter has a severe peanut allergy, YOU DON'T FLY SOUTHWEST. Even if the crew agrees to suspend peanut service for this flight, the last flight served peanuts. There are discarded peanut bags in the seat back pocket in front of your daughter. Peanut dust is on the seats, in the ventilation, and everywhere else. How will keeping peanuts off of THIS leg of the flight protect you or your child? And even if peanuts are not served on that leg, if there's still an allergic reaction, how does that affect the airline's liability, or the liability of other passengers who might have eaten peanuts in the gate area and boarded with peanut dust on their hands?
On the same flight I, and many friends of mine who also travel frequently, each had a bag of nuts in our carry-on. Forget for a moment that it would be impossible (if not unconstitutional) for flight crew to prevent people from eating their own snacks while flying. The mere fact that I had an open bag of nuts in my carry-on - even if I never took it out - could have been enough to trigger this girl's allergy. The slippery-slope potential here boggles the mind. (You had peanut butter on your bagel for breakfast this morning? Sorry, sir, you can't board this flight.)
You will never convince peanut allergy sufferers or their families that this should not be controlled, and I can see their point without agreeing with it. Consider this: I am violently allergic to dogs and cats, yet most mass-market airlines now allow pets to be stowed in the passenger compartment. I don't recall anyone ever asking me if my health would be compromised by allowing pet dander aboard. I don't protest, because I am responsible for controlling my own allergies, whether that means carrying a dust mask or an epi-pen aboard. If I choose to fly, I alone must be responsible for my own health. As much as allergens might affect me, other people have rights too; and to twist around a well-known saying, ""My rights end where your nose begins.""","Thanks for your comment, gwiener.

6656d29cb8a73166ffdad20d,23,667,"As a frequent traveler and the mom of a 23 year old with multiple food allergies, I understand how complicated this type of rule making can be.  The ""rights"" of the peanut allergy sufferer are in direct conflict with the ""rights"" of the passengers that want to eat peanuts.  For many years we avoided the conflict by traveling throughout the U.S. via motorhome.  This is not a reasonalbe option for everyone since it can be very time consuming vs. flying. 
Now that my son is older and interested in traveling to Europe, we can't reasonably get there via motorhome.  We choose our airlines carefully, carry multiple Epi-pens, pack his food from home, and I pray.
It's a very scary propostion being 35,000 feet in the air over the open ocean, knowing that each Epi-pen is effective for approximately 10-15 minutes.  My son tries to sleep most of the flight and fortunately has a much larger bladder than I do.  He gets a window seat and one of us acts as his buffer to the food cart.
This is a scary and risky proposition with a 23 year old who can quickly determine his own symptoms. It would be even scarier with a young child.
The problem with peanuts and tree nuts is that they are dry and flaky so can readily become airborne.  Their oils are sticky and stubborn so can endure through a vigorous scrub with soap and water.
My son is also allergic to milk and eggs. Nobody talks about banning them because they don't have the above mentioned properties of peanuts and tree nuts.
Traveling the world is an envigorating and enlightening experience that many would argue is as important as the structured education that we experience from 12-16+ years. Many people have to travel for work and others are required to relocate to keep their employment.
Back to the question of your rights or mine.  I prefer to live in an educated, enlightened, fulfilled, and respectful society. 
If my donut is going to set off your diabetes, I will gladly forgo the donut for six to twelve to twenty four hours.  I can live without it.
Everyone can live without peanuts and tree nuts.  So let's be reasonable and let all safely travel.  Ban the nuts and see how many more families get onboard.  Airline revenues will probably go up and that's a good thing.
BTW, I've been in 6 countries in the last 6 months, so I consider myself a frequent flyer.

We must understand that other governments may not view these rules as being benign and could very well impose restrictions on US carriers. Beware the law of unforeseen consequences.

The tarmac delay problem is not caused by airlines, and in particular foreign airlines. To submit them to significant operational or financial consequences because of something outside of their control doesn't seem appropriate.

Lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the FAA and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots. Eurocontrol (the FAA's equivalent) directs European airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport (or airspace) cannot provide it's expected capacity. When this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport. In the US when 'stuff' happens it becomes the airlines problem and they have to sort it out themselves. (competition law prohibits them from discussing solutions with their competitors).

6656d29cb8a73166ffdad20d,48,658,"As an adult with a severe tree nut allergy, I certainly empathize with the folks with peanut allergies. That said, it seems arbitrary to ban peanuts and not tree nuts given the likelihood of a serious reaction is fairly similar. If the airlines could have precautions in place, such as keeping an epipen available or offering surgical masks to those who need then, that would be a positive step. However, supplying those items really should be the responsibility of the person with the allergy or, if it is a child, the caretaker. Further, the logistics of implementing such a ban would be almost impossible. Are we looking at searching passenger luggage, banning the sale of all foods with peanuts (and since most carry the ""made in a facility that also handles"", you'd be looking at eliminating almost all foods) and regulating all restaurants at airports as well? Unfortunately, personal responsibility and proactive steps on the part of the person with the allergy is likely the only viable solution.","Thank you for sharing your personal experience and concerns about airline passenger rights.

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,22,721,"I'm a physician, epidemiologist, and mother to a four year old boy with allergies to milk, peanuts and egg.  My son's dairy allergy is severe, and he has had numerous life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk, which required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the Emergency Department.  Tests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse, but fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut; he put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild  reaction.  

I've traveled with my children and despite calling ahead, making requests, and reminding employees at the door, I've rarely had respect, let alone consistency, in any kind of peanut-free buffer zone or flight.  Several years ago Continental Airlines customer service headquarters informed me that they would serve peanuts on all flights as they were unable to guarantee a peanut free flight.  (So why not hand out weapons since they can't guarantee a weapon free flight either?)  

I've sat with my epi pen in hand on a filthy flight with visible peanut crumbs on the floor while a flight attendant insisted on offering peanuts to the passengers around me because ""it was their right.""  

Fortunately for me, my son's peanut allergy is not severe enough that it prohibits us from air travel.  Now that he is old enough to not put things in his mouth, and to protect himself, we are safer.   However, I know of many, many others in the allergy community, children and adults who simply can NOT fly.  

My son's dairy allergy is quite severe.  The world would be a much safer place for us if no one consumed milk near him.  If his skin touches anything that once touched milk, even if it was partially cleaned, he will get severe hives.  If he consumes even less than a drop, within seconds his lips, eyes and face will swell, he will be covered in hives, vomit, and be gasping for breath.  Without epinephrine he would probably die within minutes.  But milk is ubiquitous, and milk allergy relatively uncommon, so we must protect ourselves.  Peanut allergy is common, and it is a simple step to serve an alternative peanut based snacks for a short period of time.  So why is this a big problem?

The vast majority of potential reactions would be eliminated by simply avoiding snacks that have peanuts or peanut butter as an ingredient.  Peanut oil is known to contain very little of the actual peanut protein, and would be of little risk in an airborne environment.  

As a physician, I have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance.  I am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane.  In addition, most epi-pens come in two pack doses, each of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes.  Which in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS.

I've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive, and are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety.  I think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.  Of course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face.  But I am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.  This restriction is designed to protect people with allergies from the airlines callous disregard for cleanliness and for our safety, not from our fellow passengers.

My son wanted to also write a letter.

""Hi.  My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.  I am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.  If I eat a peanut I'll get sick. I ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.  It was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.  I would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.  Everybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.""

Second, either the creation of a buffer-zone or removal of peanuts base on a passenger's request is impractical. What if there are multiple allergy sufferers on the plane? Finding appropriate seat arrangements for everyone is completely impractical and time-consuming, delaying take-off. It also distracts flight attendants from completing their job. Second, among all of the other things a passenger needs to be keep in mind when traveling, notifying the airline of a peanut allergy should not be one of them. And when should the airline be notified? When is it too late to do so? And if it is too late, then what happens if someone has an allergic reaction on the plane? One possible solution is to have a little box checked off when booking a ticket to indicate a peanut allergy. But given the myriad of ways in which tickets are booked and purchased today, this is unlikely to be completely successful. The most practical solution is to just ban them on flights.

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,10,719,"I have been watching this discussion for a couple of days now, and want to weigh in on a few issues that have been raised by both supporters and opponents of a proposed peanut ban. 

First, I find that most of the discussion has been focusing on children with allergies, and related to that, good parenting. This is certainly understandable, given the increase in peanut allergies among children. But it neglects another perspective - namely, the adult allergy sufferer. 

I've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 (and I am now in my late 20s). By the age of 6, I knew how to take my medications myself. Since the EpiPen has come out, I've carried epinephrine with me. And I've always had various other medications - e.g. inhaler - on hand. I would never expect an airline to have such medications on hand, though I would expect them to have a first-aid kit.

Opponents of the ban suggest that allergy sufferers simply avoid flying. It might be possible when the sufferer is a child - perhaps it is possible for a family to drive to grandma's house for Christmas instead of taking a plane. This depends, of course, on where grandma lives - if she lives in California, and the family lives in Maine, there might be problems.

Adults, on the other hand, travel by air for a myriad of reasons. As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one. 

Towards the end of graduate school, I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them. For offices that were far away, I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city. I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air, but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication. I've had allergies since the age of 2, so I understand that sometimes, my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others. But when I take all necessary precautions and still, my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one, because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts, isn't that a little ridiculous? Is this really a fair result? I shudder to think what life will be like when I am a ""full-fledged"" working adult. Will I have to forgo promotions because I cannot travel on peanut-laden flights? It sounds dramatic, but it's not melodramatic. The only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights.","Thank you for sharing your personal experience as an adult with a peanut allergy.

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,9,733,"I would like to add on to Javier's comment. It is true that the quality of delay information is not always within the airline's control. Often, when the FAA institutes the practice of ""metering"" due to weather or high volume, the airline really can't advise the customers of the reason for a delay. In fact, in order to retain the right to take off, the airlines are required to load the plane and sit on the tarmac while the FAA figures out how to route traffic. 

Furthermore, having listened to ground control/tower communications on United flights, it's clear that the controllers can give an estimated delay, but that delay is subject to change. Again, the airline's information is only as good as the FAA's information - and, well, the situation is fluid.

To that end, DOT's rule must consider that FAA's traffic management practices and procedures might necessarily inhibit airlines' ability to comply with such regulations.",Thank you for adding more context to Javier's comment!

That said, it seems arbitrary to ban peanuts and not tree nuts given the likelihood of a serious reaction is fairly similar. If the airlines could have precautions in place, such as keeping an epipen available or offering surgical masks to those who need then, that would be a positive step. However, supplying those items really should be the responsibility of the person with the allergy or, if it is a child, the caretaker. Further, the logistics of implementing such a ban would be almost impossible. Are we looking at searching passenger luggage, banning the sale of all foods with peanuts (and since most carry the ""made in a facility that also handles"", you'd be looking at eliminating almost all foods) and regulating all restaurants at airports as well?

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,82,735,"I disagree.  The ""rights"" debate is not a good perspective in this context.  As used by opponents of accommodations, it is an inflammatory bandwagon fallacy that simply appeals to an ideologically-motivated distrust of government and regulation in any case whatsoever.  Even if ""rights"" was a good perspective, still, there are always competing rights to resolve.  In this case, the equal right to travel safely trumps the right to eat a bag of peanuts.  

The simple reality is that peanuts have become – for reasons not thoroughly understood – a potentially fatal allergen for a growing number of Americans.  There problem will get worse before it gets better, as studies indicate that prevalence has tripled among children in recent years.  Unless accommodations are made, this will represent lost income for airlines.  

There does not need to be a death record to make this decision.  What sort of standard is that?  Put the onus on the peanut industry to finalize the non-allergenic peanut, not on those suffering life-threatening peanut allergies to ante up a few more deaths.

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,60,784,"Let's keep in mind that a bumped passenger may miss a cruise ship departure, miss a connecting flight, lose a day (or sometimes more) of a prepaid vacation, or miss a wedding or funeral because the airline was greedy and didn't want even one empty seat on their flight.  If being bumped from a flight caused additional problems for the bumped passenger(s) then the passenger(s) should be able to submit proof of loss and the airline should have to compensate WITHOUT LIMIT in addition to the proposed penalties.

I also like the idea of pre notification of bumping.  It can cost well over $100 to get to an airport (for example, central NJ to JFK is about $150 and for a long vacation this is cheaper than airport parking).  When a passenger is bumped and the next available flight is the next day this can mean an additional $300+ in travel costs.","Thank you for sharing your concerns about the impact of bumping on passengers.

Well ... contrary to what the gate agent told me, the voucher is only good on US Airways-coded flights; and as I live in the Southwest, there's a very good chance this voucher will expire worthless.

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,94,760,"My son is severely allergic to peanuts and has allergic reactions as a result of being around people eating peanuts due to the peanut dust in the air. 

We had to travel internationally and were able to work with the airline to book peanut free roundtrip flights after submitting a letter from my son's allergist. The airline did everything they could including serving snacks without peanuts, putting allergy alert stickers on our seats, and making an announcement asking passengers to refrain from eating their peanut snacks.

My son was fine going to our destination but had an allergic reaction within minutes of being seated for our return trip. Since he didn't eat any peanuts, we gave him some benadryl, moved him to a different row, and wiped down his new seat. 

We were fortunate that his reaction was not severe enough to require an epi-pen injection and a trip to the hospital in another country. We suspect that he was reacting to peanut residue in the area of his seat from the previous flight. We may not be so lucky next time because we have been told that the next reaction is even stronger than the last.

Even though we were on a peanut-free fight, my son still was not safe because of the peanut residue on the plane from a previous flight. If peanuts are banned on all flights, my son would have been safe. 

When an allergic reaction occurs high up in the sky over a huge ocean, and an epi-pen injection can only give a person an extra 20 minutes, there is not enough time to turn the plane around and take the person to the hospital. I believe that it is reasonable to ban peanuts from airline flights if that assures the safety of a passenger that has a severe peanut allergy. This decision could mean life or death for someone.

Having said that, how exactly would such a ban on peanuts be enforced? I was on a Southwest flight not long ago, where a mom demanded that peanuts not be served on her flight with her daughter. The flight attendants complied. Mind you, this was Southwest Airlines, which had the marketing tagline ""We Fly For Peanuts"" for years. Common sense dictates that if your daughter has a severe peanut allergy, YOU DON'T FLY SOUTHWEST. Even if the crew agrees to suspend peanut service for this flight, the last flight served peanuts. There are discarded peanut bags in the seat back pocket in front of your daughter. Peanut dust is on the seats, in the ventilation, and everywhere else. How will keeping peanuts off of THIS leg of the flight protect you or your child? And even if peanuts are not served on that leg, if there's still an allergic reaction, how does that affect the airline's liability, or the liability of other passengers who might have eaten peanuts in the gate area and boarded with peanut dust on their hands?
On the same flight I, and many friends of mine who also travel frequently, each had a bag of nuts in our carry-on. Forget for a moment that it would be impossible (if not unconstitutional) for flight crew to prevent people from eating their own snacks while flying. The mere fact that I had an open bag of nuts in my carry-on - even if I never took it out - could have been enough to trigger this girl's allergy. The slippery-slope potential here boggles the mind. (You had peanut butter on your bagel for breakfast this morning? Sorry, sir, you can't board this flight.)
You will never convince peanut allergy sufferers or their families that this should not be controlled, and I can see their point without agreeing with it. Consider this: I am violently allergic to dogs and cats, yet most mass-market airlines now allow pets to be stowed in the passenger compartment. I don't recall anyone ever asking me if my health would be compromised by allowing pet dander aboard. I don't protest, because I am responsible for controlling my own allergies, whether that means carrying a dust mask or an epi-pen aboard. If I choose to fly, I alone must be responsible for my own health. As much as allergens might affect me, other people have rights too; and to twist around a well-known saying, ""My rights end where your nose begins.""","Thanks for your comment, gwiener.

Passengers may lack check cashing privileges away from their home airport, yet face unplanned and likely elevated expenses after being ""bumped.""   They should have a mandatory option of cash payment.  An credit card credit, if immediate, would be more secure and as useful to more passengers than either a check or cash.

The proposed compensation limits are too low to provide an incentive to the airlines to limit overbooking and may be arbitrarily unfair to certain travelers.

This includes airborne inhalation, cross contamination with other foods, or contact with residue left from previous and nearby passengers.  It is not simply a matter of ""don't eat it.""

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,87,639,"I have a young son who is beyond Class 6 (highest class)for peanuts/tree nuts. For him, it simply is not a matter of ""passing up"" on a snack.  Anaphylaxis can happen much more readily for him by the transfer of oils (peanut oils on airline tray tables, arm rests). It can also happen by airborne dust.  In a flight where peanuts are being served and all 100+ bags go POOF at the same time they are opened - well, let's just say it would be a mother's nightmare.  Especialy with recycled cabin air.  Even without a peanut allergy, peanuts are just such a choking hazard for any small children.  Why serve them?  There are plenty of reasonable alternatives.  I recall when my son was first diagnosed, 1 week prior to Christmas.  Our pediatrician called us at all of our nighttime emergency numbers just to ensure we wouldn't step onto any holiday airline flights without an epi-pen and proper documentation of his condition.  I was FLOORED to f sind out that Delta still served peanuts.  Really??  Peanut allergy is unlike some other food allergies in that there are multiple ways to have reaction (ingestion, touching, breathing).  My suggestion would be to ban peanut products on all airlines.  But that still does not/will  not control what snacks others bring on.  So I would suggest they still offer peanut free buffer zones and have some method of ensuring passengers in those rows are aware of what that means (don't bring or open peanut snacks). I also think that pre-boarding should be an option, so that peanut families can go and wipe down the tray tables/arm rests themselves and feel comfortable with the environment in which their child will be sitting. I've been on one too many flights were peanuts have been banned simply due to an allergic person flying...and I feel SO MUCH sympathy for those families, because the airline staff does not seem to be good at respecting their privacy. In fact, they almost act begruding or point out the poor child to other.  What kid wants to be labeled?  In all honesty, I can't see making the switch to peanut free snacks to be that big an impact to the airlines. As long as items are clearly labeled (most, not all pretzels) are o.k.  If nothing else, I am so very appreciative that this issue is gaining attention.  I don't think airlines realize how many passengers don't fly them due to their poor policies. In fact, I learned so much already today reading these message boards. I will make it a point to frequent the airlines (that serve my area) where people seem to have had really positive and supportive environments when flying with their children.  Great info for me to have as a parent.   I also wonder if you couldn't look into how the major sports arenas handle peanut allergies.  Most will offer at least one ""peanut free"" day so that children can enjoy major league sports like baseball etc.  So it can be done.

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,35,660,There must be a complete ban on tree nuts and peanuts on planes.  It is a closed space. I am allergic to peanuts and almonds and I am impacted every time I fly.  A nut free zone does not work since the dust from nuts gets in the closed air system of the plane.  For the time that people are on planes there should be consideration of others who have no control as to the reactions they have to nuts.  For almost all other foods the allergy only occurs if the food is ingested so you can easily avoid the allergic reaction but not eating the food.  This is not true for many of us with nut allergies - we react if other people are eating the food since it is an airborne allergy.  I do fly but I have to take multiple Benadryl pills every 4 hours to keep from reacting to the airborne dust of the nuts.  This works for now but I always wonder when it will no longer be enough.  An epipen is not the answer as it lasts only look enough for the plane to land which is not a practical solution when you are flying on a long flight over water and would certainly be a much greater inconvenience to the other passengers than a ban on nut products on planes if the plane was able to land.  The rules airlines have are ridiculous - Southwest is not nut free they will not serve nuts but if you fly a late flight the peanuts are all over the floor and seats.  Some other airlines have the rows around you 'nut free' but advise you they can do nothing if the person seated next to you brings nuts on and wants to eat them.  Other airlines with advance notice will not serve nuts but all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts and will not stop the person from eating them if they wish to.  So you can have a 'nut free' flight and the person sitting next to you can take out their package of peanuts and eat away - and the airlines will do nothing to help you. Again all nuts should be banned from airplanes unless it is your own private plane - then go ahead and eat what you want. ,"Thanks, all, for such a spirited discussion.

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,23,667,"As a frequent traveler and the mom of a 23 year old with multiple food allergies, I understand how complicated this type of rule making can be.  The ""rights"" of the peanut allergy sufferer are in direct conflict with the ""rights"" of the passengers that want to eat peanuts.  For many years we avoided the conflict by traveling throughout the U.S. via motorhome.  This is not a reasonalbe option for everyone since it can be very time consuming vs. flying. 
Now that my son is older and interested in traveling to Europe, we can't reasonably get there via motorhome.  We choose our airlines carefully, carry multiple Epi-pens, pack his food from home, and I pray.
It's a very scary propostion being 35,000 feet in the air over the open ocean, knowing that each Epi-pen is effective for approximately 10-15 minutes.  My son tries to sleep most of the flight and fortunately has a much larger bladder than I do.  He gets a window seat and one of us acts as his buffer to the food cart.
This is a scary and risky proposition with a 23 year old who can quickly determine his own symptoms. It would be even scarier with a young child.
The problem with peanuts and tree nuts is that they are dry and flaky so can readily become airborne.  Their oils are sticky and stubborn so can endure through a vigorous scrub with soap and water.
My son is also allergic to milk and eggs. Nobody talks about banning them because they don't have the above mentioned properties of peanuts and tree nuts.
Traveling the world is an envigorating and enlightening experience that many would argue is as important as the structured education that we experience from 12-16+ years. Many people have to travel for work and others are required to relocate to keep their employment.
Back to the question of your rights or mine.  I prefer to live in an educated, enlightened, fulfilled, and respectful society. 
If my donut is going to set off your diabetes, I will gladly forgo the donut for six to twelve to twenty four hours.  I can live without it.
Everyone can live without peanuts and tree nuts.  So let's be reasonable and let all safely travel.  Ban the nuts and see how many more families get onboard.  Airline revenues will probably go up and that's a good thing.
BTW, I've been in 6 countries in the last 6 months, so I consider myself a frequent flyer.

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,59,663,"Regardless of the formula used by airlines to compensate bumped passengers or even if flights are delayed for over 3 hours that fact remains ailines are not forthcomiong with passengers about their rights.  Example: Flight delay due to mechanical problem with an anticpated wait time of 3 hours.  Technically the airline is required to compensate passengers with a meal voucher.  It's been my experience you'll get the voucher but only if you ask. Many families & individuals traveling are on a budget - that 3 hour delay can kill a budget for unexpected meals.  Airlines should be required to announce and post on the gate flight board that  passengers can claim a meal voucher during the delay.  Vouchers ahould be handy to the airliner's customer service staff at the gate.

It's all about establishing systems that are clear and protocol is established.  That means if a flight is delayed longer than 3 hours or a passenger is bumped as system is in place that is tranparent to airline personell and airline customers.  No tiny font but rather written in a conspicuous place, in large font, and clear to all what the policy is, how it is applied and what process is used for a passenger to receive compensation - be it a meal voucher or for being bumped.  Clear and understandable to all with no opportunity for any airline or passenger to work the system.","Thank you for sharing your personal experience with flight delays and compensation.

a)  those who believe that it is right to help the few to live life to the fullest of their abilities, and 
b) those who believe that no-one has the right to pass laws they do not agree with .
And it is very obvious that a consensus will not be agreed upon here.

I would like to thank the DOT for having the courage to bring this matter up and to ask for comments from the public, especially after being told by Congress in 1998 to drop the matter or risk having funding removed. No doubt the peanut lobby played a major part in that directive.

Those who have legitimate life threatening allergies (and there are many) have a right to be heard. Unfortunately, there appear to be many who wish to snuff out these voices because certain rights may be impeded.

 Congress should listen to the doctors and scientists who study these disabilities and allow the experts to make their honest recommendations. I understand that the peanut lobby will probably want their say, but money should not outweigh logic and science.

I would prefer a total ban on peanut and tree nut foods being served on flights. 

My granddaughter has been medically diagnosed as having several allergies, including these two items. We are not hysterical, and we would be much happier if these allergies could disappear or be cured. Unfortunately, the science is not there yet. So, the family must all read labels, call companies when the labels are not clear, talk with restaurants, take ""safe"" food with us when no other solution is possible, and always carry a bag with any possibly required medications. We accept these as our responsibility.

We are restricted from being able to take family vacations very far from home because of the negative attitudes of the airline companies, or lack of choices because of living next to a Delta hub. This does not affect one person, this affects 12! I would have thought that the airlines would have taken this into account when looking at their bottom dollar, but Delta has stated that they will not restrict peanuts because their home is in Georgia! 

The negative comments from some of the writers posted here are not helpful in defining what is the correct solution to allow allergy sufferers, and their families, to fly.

Get the feedback from the experts, make logical decisions, and fund the research into finding cures or relief for those suffering from the disability of life threatening allergies. All life threatening allergies! But please do not wait until someone dies before acting.","Thank you for the comment smr.

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,20,709,"I have been allergic to peanuts for nearly 40-years!  I typically fly Southwest Airlines - a leading airline in distributing peanuts to passengers as THE ONLY SNACK on many of their flights.  After a typical flight, I will have itchy, watery eyes sometimes to the point where I can barely keep my eyes open.  Luckily my allergy is not AS BAD as many - but I can empathize with those with worse conditions.  In Southwest's defense, if I would call ahead of time and inform them I was allergic to peanuts they would gladly air out the aircraft and refrain from serving peanuts on my flight.  Although I am not against the idea of peanuts being restricted from all flights, I do appreciate people's comments regarding the absurdity of such an all-encompassing rule.  I think an effective and simple solution might be to ask passengers either verbally when tickets are purchased person-to-person, or via a question prior to an e-ticket purchase that asks the traveler if they are allergic to peanuts.  If yes - then that particular flight can be aired out of prior peanuts and peanuts not served on that flight.

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,24,787,"TELL THE TRUTH immediately, boys, and treat passengers like valued human beings. That's it. 

Southwest does it, and they have the most loyal passengers in the industry. It CAN be done, if you have the will to do it. The price SW shows online is the REAL price, not a teaser fare that shoots up rapidly when the taxes, fees, surcharges, etc. are added.  SW does not charge me nuisance fees (baggage, changing a reservation, one-way flights, etc.). If they can do it, so can the rest of you. I just wish BWI were closer to the Northern VA location I frequent, so I could use SW all the time. 

I fly at least once every week, usually between Columbus, OH and the DC area. During the past year the Sunday night delays on USAir (DCA-CMH), United (IAD-CMH), and even SW (BWI-CMH) in that order have been abismal, with delays at LEAST 30-50% of the time. When cancellations were made, passengers weren't told until 5-10 minutes before departure. These have mostly been mechanical problems (clearly avoidable with better management), crew shortages, and non-severe weather. Efficient, effective management would prevent the vast majority of these problems. 

One brief example will illustrate. On Sunday, June 13 I was scheduled on US3234 DCA-CMH at 4:55 pm. When I arrived at the gate the plane and crew were there. Good start, eh? At about 10 min. before boarding time the gate agent said they'd made a minor repair to the plane, but the paperwork had not arrived from BRAZIL! ""We'll know more in 30 minutes."" This went on until after 7 pm, at which time I re-booked for the next morning and went home. The plane did eventually fly, 3 hours late, but meanwhile I've wasted 5 hours sitting at an overheated, overcrowded, hopelessly noisy National Airport because USAir can't get paperwork faxed from BRAZIL. Why did it have to come from Brazil? Why don't they have back up plans/management solutions for such routine problems. They are bound to occur. Plan for it and head off these problems. 

During last winter's blizzards in the East, SW was the only airline that told the truth and notified us many hours in advance that flights were cancelled. United and USAir constantly insisted the flights were going, when in fact they were not.  

If the carriers want the privilege of using our air space and our public airports (supported with tax-payer subsidies), they should be held to this standard. TELL THE TRUTH AS SOON AS YOU KNOW IT, and fix the problem promptly if it's anything other than severe weather that is truly beyond your control. PERIOD. Why wait 30 minutes unnecessarily?

We must understand that other governments may not view these rules as being benign and could very well impose restrictions on US carriers. Beware the law of unforeseen consequences.

The tarmac delay problem is not caused by airlines, and in particular foreign airlines. To submit them to significant operational or financial consequences because of something outside of their control doesn't seem appropriate.

Lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the FAA and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots. Eurocontrol (the FAA's equivalent) directs European airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport (or airspace) cannot provide it's expected capacity. When this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport. In the US when 'stuff' happens it becomes the airlines problem and they have to sort it out themselves. (competition law prohibits them from discussing solutions with their competitors).

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,97,768,"Let them overbook, but make it painful if they deny boarding.  The suggested penalties are not strong enough.   The penalty should apply to all ticket holders except for company employees traveling on free tickets as part of their job.  

First and foremost, whatever the penalty it must be paid in check or credit to a credit card immediately at the gate.  No more vouchers, which tend to be be worthless because of the airlines travel rules and restrictions.  

The starting point for the penalty should be the full fare cost of the ticket in whatever class the original ticket was issued.  So full Y, B, or F fare; no discount.  It should include all fees and taxes that would apply to the ticket if purchased by the consumer.  (This gets DOT out of the business of determining the value and worrying about inflation adjusted costs; the airline has already done the computation of the value of the ticket.)  The consumer should also be booked at the airlines expense on the next available flight in the same class as the original ticket.  

For every subsequent denied boarding for the consumer, they should get the same amount as the original payment to thus encourage the airline to get the passenger to their destination.

Airlines should not be allowed to offer any reduction to this penalty but could offer more in order to get passengers to deplane.  Vouchers do not count; only cash incentives should be allowed.

The penalty should apply to any size commercial flight whether it be five, ten, or 300 seats.  

Only when the penalty for over booking is truly onerous will the airlines stop this despicable practice.  I have no sympathy for the airline as 90% of the tickets they sell are non-refundable and non-cancelable; so they cannot be used and the airline gets its money. 

As to the argument that costs will increase, etc., then let the airlines sell a standby ticket which is not subject to these rules and penalties and let the consumer decide if they want to take the risk.  However, knowing how the airlines work, no more than 5% of all tickets sold nor more than 5% of total seat capacity of the flight (whichever is less) should be permitted to be sold in this special category (otherwise they would immediately sell all their seats like this to avoid the penalties.)  

Good luck.  I don't envy you up against the lawyers the airlines have on their payroll to say nothing of the pressure the airlines will exert on congress to get this watered down.

667979c7e5af12e2697d92f2,83,635,"I have one child who is severely allergic to peanuts.  She is one of those few who react from dust, practically.  We made a decision at an early age simply not to fly.  The airlines have no cohesive, consistent policy and this issue is not something we can show up and be surprised about.

It would help children, and adults, like my daughter if the DOT banned peanuts on all flights.  Of course, asking airlines to stop serving peanuts is not enough.  The DOT would need to require that no passenger bring them aboard as well.  Let's face it, cuts to the airlines have put food at the bottom of their priority list (hence handing out ""snacks"" like peanuts).  So...if you will be flying for hours and have little prospect for food, what is the perfect protein packed food you can bring that needs no refrigeration?

I almost feel like banning peanuts would give people a false sense of security UNLESS a complete and total ban was instituted (airline & passengers).

That being said, I appreciate the argument about other allergies, as well as perfume (though I do not believe anaphylaxis is generally an issue for those allergic to perfume).  Why do we need food on board at all?  Perhaps that is a bit naive and narrow-minded, but how about a drinks-only rule?  Do 1 or 2 hours flights really need to serve ANY kind of food?  Propose that to the airlines as a cost saving measure!  (Of course, longer flights or international is a whole other ballgame.)

So, to answer the DOT questions over there <---- I would say:

1.  From empirical evidence, I believe there is a strong likelihood of a peanut allergy sufferer having a severe reaction if the conditions were right.  My daughter developed hives from peanut shell residue that had touched a banana peel.  She touched the peel to her skin and broke out in hives.  It doesn't take much.

2.  I feel strongly that people should take responsibility for themselves and, therefore, would expect all allergy sufferers to carry their own epinephrine.  However, I am under the assumption that a plane would have first aid available and possibly a defibrillator.  Adding epinephrine to this kit would only be a good business practice.

3.  I would feel (relatively) safe on a plane where peanut-ingredient products are banned from airline and passengers, but ""may contains"" were permitted.  My allergic daughter would not consume them, but the chance of her having a reaction from cross contact or inhalation are virtually nil.  Again, it's about personal responsibility.  We will take care of her food.  We just need help keeping her alive and safe from other peoples food.

5bbbcd283895e3000163213f,22,721,"I'm a physician, epidemiologist, and mother to a four year old boy with allergies to milk, peanuts and egg.  My son's dairy allergy is severe, and he has had numerous life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk, which required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the Emergency Department.  Tests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse, but fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut; he put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild  reaction.  

I've traveled with my children and despite calling ahead, making requests, and reminding employees at the door, I've rarely had respect, let alone consistency, in any kind of peanut-free buffer zone or flight.  Several years ago Continental Airlines customer service headquarters informed me that they would serve peanuts on all flights as they were unable to guarantee a peanut free flight.  (So why not hand out weapons since they can't guarantee a weapon free flight either?)  

I've sat with my epi pen in hand on a filthy flight with visible peanut crumbs on the floor while a flight attendant insisted on offering peanuts to the passengers around me because ""it was their right.""  

Fortunately for me, my son's peanut allergy is not severe enough that it prohibits us from air travel.  Now that he is old enough to not put things in his mouth, and to protect himself, we are safer.   However, I know of many, many others in the allergy community, children and adults who simply can NOT fly.  

My son's dairy allergy is quite severe.  The world would be a much safer place for us if no one consumed milk near him.  If his skin touches anything that once touched milk, even if it was partially cleaned, he will get severe hives.  If he consumes even less than a drop, within seconds his lips, eyes and face will swell, he will be covered in hives, vomit, and be gasping for breath.  Without epinephrine he would probably die within minutes.  But milk is ubiquitous, and milk allergy relatively uncommon, so we must protect ourselves.  Peanut allergy is common, and it is a simple step to serve an alternative peanut based snacks for a short period of time.  So why is this a big problem?

The vast majority of potential reactions would be eliminated by simply avoiding snacks that have peanuts or peanut butter as an ingredient.  Peanut oil is known to contain very little of the actual peanut protein, and would be of little risk in an airborne environment.  

As a physician, I have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance.  I am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane.  In addition, most epi-pens come in two pack doses, each of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes.  Which in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS.

I've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive, and are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety.  I think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.  Of course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face.  But I am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.  This restriction is designed to protect people with allergies from the airlines callous disregard for cleanliness and for our safety, not from our fellow passengers.

My son wanted to also write a letter.

""Hi.  My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.  I am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.  If I eat a peanut I'll get sick. I ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.  It was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.  I would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.  Everybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.""

Second, either the creation of a buffer-zone or removal of peanuts base on a passenger's request is impractical. What if there are multiple allergy sufferers on the plane? Finding appropriate seat arrangements for everyone is completely impractical and time-consuming, delaying take-off. It also distracts flight attendants from completing their job. Second, among all of the other things a passenger needs to be keep in mind when traveling, notifying the airline of a peanut allergy should not be one of them. And when should the airline be notified? When is it too late to do so? And if it is too late, then what happens if someone has an allergic reaction on the plane? One possible solution is to have a little box checked off when booking a ticket to indicate a peanut allergy.

5bbbcd283895e3000163213f,10,719,"I have been watching this discussion for a couple of days now, and want to weigh in on a few issues that have been raised by both supporters and opponents of a proposed peanut ban. 

First, I find that most of the discussion has been focusing on children with allergies, and related to that, good parenting. This is certainly understandable, given the increase in peanut allergies among children. But it neglects another perspective - namely, the adult allergy sufferer. 

I've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 (and I am now in my late 20s). By the age of 6, I knew how to take my medications myself. Since the EpiPen has come out, I've carried epinephrine with me. And I've always had various other medications - e.g. inhaler - on hand. I would never expect an airline to have such medications on hand, though I would expect them to have a first-aid kit.

Opponents of the ban suggest that allergy sufferers simply avoid flying. It might be possible when the sufferer is a child - perhaps it is possible for a family to drive to grandma's house for Christmas instead of taking a plane. This depends, of course, on where grandma lives - if she lives in California, and the family lives in Maine, there might be problems.

Adults, on the other hand, travel by air for a myriad of reasons. As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one. 

Towards the end of graduate school, I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them. For offices that were far away, I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city. I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air, but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication. I've had allergies since the age of 2, so I understand that sometimes, my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others. But when I take all necessary precautions and still, my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one, because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts, isn't that a little ridiculous? Is this really a fair result? I shudder to think what life will be like when I am a ""full-fledged"" working adult. Will I have to forgo promotions because I cannot travel on peanut-laden flights? It sounds dramatic, but it's not melodramatic. The only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights.","Thank you for sharing your personal experience as an adult with a peanut allergy.

5bbbcd283895e3000163213f,9,733,"I would like to add on to Javier's comment. It is true that the quality of delay information is not always within the airline's control. Often, when the FAA institutes the practice of ""metering"" due to weather or high volume, the airline really can't advise the customers of the reason for a delay. In fact, in order to retain the right to take off, the airlines are required to load the plane and sit on the tarmac while the FAA figures out how to route traffic. 

Furthermore, having listened to ground control/tower communications on United flights, it's clear that the controllers can give an estimated delay, but that delay is subject to change. Again, the airline's information is only as good as the FAA's information - and, well, the situation is fluid.

To that end, DOT's rule must consider that FAA's traffic management practices and procedures might necessarily inhibit airlines' ability to comply with such regulations.",Thank you for adding more context to Javier's comment!

5bbbcd283895e3000163213f,94,760,"My son is severely allergic to peanuts and has allergic reactions as a result of being around people eating peanuts due to the peanut dust in the air. 

We had to travel internationally and were able to work with the airline to book peanut free roundtrip flights after submitting a letter from my son's allergist. The airline did everything they could including serving snacks without peanuts, putting allergy alert stickers on our seats, and making an announcement asking passengers to refrain from eating their peanut snacks.

My son was fine going to our destination but had an allergic reaction within minutes of being seated for our return trip. Since he didn't eat any peanuts, we gave him some benadryl, moved him to a different row, and wiped down his new seat. 

We were fortunate that his reaction was not severe enough to require an epi-pen injection and a trip to the hospital in another country. We suspect that he was reacting to peanut residue in the area of his seat from the previous flight. We may not be so lucky next time because we have been told that the next reaction is even stronger than the last.

Even though we were on a peanut-free fight, my son still was not safe because of the peanut residue on the plane from a previous flight. If peanuts are banned on all flights, my son would have been safe. 

When an allergic reaction occurs high up in the sky over a huge ocean, and an epi-pen injection can only give a person an extra 20 minutes, there is not enough time to turn the plane around and take the person to the hospital. I believe that it is reasonable to ban peanuts from airline flights if that assures the safety of a passenger that has a severe peanut allergy. This decision could mean life or death for someone.

5bbbcd283895e3000163213f,41,723,"I have a great deal of empathy for those who have, or are related to someone who has, severe peanut allergies. Clearly, their health is much more important that my desire to snack on peanuts for a few hours, and I doubt many people could debate that.
Having said that, how exactly would such a ban on peanuts be enforced? I was on a Southwest flight not long ago, where a mom demanded that peanuts not be served on her flight with her daughter. The flight attendants complied. Mind you, this was Southwest Airlines, which had the marketing tagline ""We Fly For Peanuts"" for years. Common sense dictates that if your daughter has a severe peanut allergy, YOU DON'T FLY SOUTHWEST. Even if the crew agrees to suspend peanut service for this flight, the last flight served peanuts. There are discarded peanut bags in the seat back pocket in front of your daughter. Peanut dust is on the seats, in the ventilation, and everywhere else. How will keeping peanuts off of THIS leg of the flight protect you or your child? And even if peanuts are not served on that leg, if there's still an allergic reaction, how does that affect the airline's liability, or the liability of other passengers who might have eaten peanuts in the gate area and boarded with peanut dust on their hands?
On the same flight I, and many friends of mine who also travel frequently, each had a bag of nuts in our carry-on. Forget for a moment that it would be impossible (if not unconstitutional) for flight crew to prevent people from eating their own snacks while flying. The mere fact that I had an open bag of nuts in my carry-on - even if I never took it out - could have been enough to trigger this girl's allergy. The slippery-slope potential here boggles the mind. (You had peanut butter on your bagel for breakfast this morning? Sorry, sir, you can't board this flight.)
You will never convince peanut allergy sufferers or their families that this should not be controlled, and I can see their point without agreeing with it. Consider this: I am violently allergic to dogs and cats, yet most mass-market airlines now allow pets to be stowed in the passenger compartment. I don't recall anyone ever asking me if my health would be compromised by allowing pet dander aboard. I don't protest, because I am responsible for controlling my own allergies, whether that means carrying a dust mask or an epi-pen aboard. If I choose to fly, I alone must be responsible for my own health. As much as allergens might affect me, other people have rights too; and to twist around a well-known saying, ""My rights end where your nose begins.""","Thanks for your comment, gwiener.

5bbbcd283895e3000163213f,35,660,There must be a complete ban on tree nuts and peanuts on planes.  It is a closed space. I am allergic to peanuts and almonds and I am impacted every time I fly.  A nut free zone does not work since the dust from nuts gets in the closed air system of the plane.  For the time that people are on planes there should be consideration of others who have no control as to the reactions they have to nuts.  For almost all other foods the allergy only occurs if the food is ingested so you can easily avoid the allergic reaction but not eating the food.  This is not true for many of us with nut allergies - we react if other people are eating the food since it is an airborne allergy.  I do fly but I have to take multiple Benadryl pills every 4 hours to keep from reacting to the airborne dust of the nuts.  This works for now but I always wonder when it will no longer be enough.  An epipen is not the answer as it lasts only look enough for the plane to land which is not a practical solution when you are flying on a long flight over water and would certainly be a much greater inconvenience to the other passengers than a ban on nut products on planes if the plane was able to land.  The rules airlines have are ridiculous - Southwest is not nut free they will not serve nuts but if you fly a late flight the peanuts are all over the floor and seats.  Some other airlines have the rows around you 'nut free' but advise you they can do nothing if the person seated next to you brings nuts on and wants to eat them.  Other airlines with advance notice will not serve nuts but all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts and will not stop the person from eating them if they wish to.  So you can have a 'nut free' flight and the person sitting next to you can take out their package of peanuts and eat away - and the airlines will do nothing to help you.

5bbbcd283895e3000163213f,23,667,"As a frequent traveler and the mom of a 23 year old with multiple food allergies, I understand how complicated this type of rule making can be.  The ""rights"" of the peanut allergy sufferer are in direct conflict with the ""rights"" of the passengers that want to eat peanuts.  For many years we avoided the conflict by traveling throughout the U.S. via motorhome.  This is not a reasonalbe option for everyone since it can be very time consuming vs. flying. 
Now that my son is older and interested in traveling to Europe, we can't reasonably get there via motorhome.  We choose our airlines carefully, carry multiple Epi-pens, pack his food from home, and I pray.
It's a very scary propostion being 35,000 feet in the air over the open ocean, knowing that each Epi-pen is effective for approximately 10-15 minutes.  My son tries to sleep most of the flight and fortunately has a much larger bladder than I do.  He gets a window seat and one of us acts as his buffer to the food cart.
This is a scary and risky proposition with a 23 year old who can quickly determine his own symptoms. It would be even scarier with a young child.
The problem with peanuts and tree nuts is that they are dry and flaky so can readily become airborne.  Their oils are sticky and stubborn so can endure through a vigorous scrub with soap and water.
My son is also allergic to milk and eggs. Nobody talks about banning them because they don't have the above mentioned properties of peanuts and tree nuts.
Traveling the world is an envigorating and enlightening experience that many would argue is as important as the structured education that we experience from 12-16+ years. Many people have to travel for work and others are required to relocate to keep their employment.
Back to the question of your rights or mine.  I prefer to live in an educated, enlightened, fulfilled, and respectful society. 
If my donut is going to set off your diabetes, I will gladly forgo the donut for six to twelve to twenty four hours.  I can live without it.
Everyone can live without peanuts and tree nuts.  So let's be reasonable and let all safely travel.  Ban the nuts and see how many more families get onboard.  Airline revenues will probably go up and that's a good thing.
BTW, I've been in 6 countries in the last 6 months, so I consider myself a frequent flyer.

Example: Flight delay due to mechanical problem with an anticpated wait time of 3 hours.  Technically the airline is required to compensate passengers with a meal voucher.  It's been my experience you'll get the voucher but only if you ask. Many families & individuals traveling are on a budget - that 3 hour delay can kill a budget for unexpected meals.

a)  those who believe that it is right to help the few to live life to the fullest of their abilities, and 
b) those who believe that no-one has the right to pass laws they do not agree with .
And it is very obvious that a consensus will not be agreed upon here.

I would like to thank the DOT for having the courage to bring this matter up and to ask for comments from the public, especially after being told by Congress in 1998 to drop the matter or risk having funding removed. No doubt the peanut lobby played a major part in that directive.

Those who have legitimate life threatening allergies (and there are many) have a right to be heard. Unfortunately, there appear to be many who wish to snuff out these voices because certain rights may be impeded.

 Congress should listen to the doctors and scientists who study these disabilities and allow the experts to make their honest recommendations. I understand that the peanut lobby will probably want their say, but money should not outweigh logic and science.

I would prefer a total ban on peanut and tree nut foods being served on flights. 

My granddaughter has been medically diagnosed as having several allergies, including these two items. We are not hysterical, and we would be much happier if these allergies could disappear or be cured. Unfortunately, the science is not there yet. So, the family must all read labels, call companies when the labels are not clear, talk with restaurants, take ""safe"" food with us when no other solution is possible, and always carry a bag with any possibly required medications. We accept these as our responsibility.

We are restricted from being able to take family vacations very far from home because of the negative attitudes of the airline companies, or lack of choices because of living next to a Delta hub. This does not affect one person, this affects 12! I would have thought that the airlines would have taken this into account when looking at their bottom dollar, but Delta has stated that they will not restrict peanuts because their home is in Georgia! 

The negative comments from some of the writers posted here are not helpful in defining what is the correct solution to allow allergy sufferers, and their families, to fly.

5bbbcd283895e3000163213f,20,709,"I have been allergic to peanuts for nearly 40-years!  I typically fly Southwest Airlines - a leading airline in distributing peanuts to passengers as THE ONLY SNACK on many of their flights.  After a typical flight, I will have itchy, watery eyes sometimes to the point where I can barely keep my eyes open.  Luckily my allergy is not AS BAD as many - but I can empathize with those with worse conditions.  In Southwest's defense, if I would call ahead of time and inform them I was allergic to peanuts they would gladly air out the aircraft and refrain from serving peanuts on my flight.  Although I am not against the idea of peanuts being restricted from all flights, I do appreciate people's comments regarding the absurdity of such an all-encompassing rule.  I think an effective and simple solution might be to ask passengers either verbally when tickets are purchased person-to-person, or via a question prior to an e-ticket purchase that asks the traveler if they are allergic to peanuts.  If yes - then that particular flight can be aired out of prior peanuts and peanuts not served on that flight.  I look forward to seeing the outcome to this issue.",Thank you for sharing your personal experience with peanut allergies on Southwest Airlines flights.

We must understand that other governments may not view these rules as being benign and could very well impose restrictions on US carriers. Beware the law of unforeseen consequences.

The tarmac delay problem is not caused by airlines, and in particular foreign airlines. To submit them to significant operational or financial consequences because of something outside of their control doesn't seem appropriate.

Lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the FAA and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots. Eurocontrol (the FAA's equivalent) directs European airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport (or airspace) cannot provide it's expected capacity. When this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport. In the US when 'stuff' happens it becomes the airlines problem and they have to sort it out themselves. (competition law prohibits them from discussing solutions with their competitors). 

Let's fix the problem, not the symptoms.",Thank you for your comment.

5bbbcd283895e3000163213f,97,768,"Let them overbook, but make it painful if they deny boarding.  The suggested penalties are not strong enough.   The penalty should apply to all ticket holders except for company employees traveling on free tickets as part of their job.  

First and foremost, whatever the penalty it must be paid in check or credit to a credit card immediately at the gate.  No more vouchers, which tend to be be worthless because of the airlines travel rules and restrictions.  

The starting point for the penalty should be the full fare cost of the ticket in whatever class the original ticket was issued.  So full Y, B, or F fare; no discount.  It should include all fees and taxes that would apply to the ticket if purchased by the consumer.  (This gets DOT out of the business of determining the value and worrying about inflation adjusted costs; the airline has already done the computation of the value of the ticket.)  The consumer should also be booked at the airlines expense on the next available flight in the same class as the original ticket.  

For every subsequent denied boarding for the consumer, they should get the same amount as the original payment to thus encourage the airline to get the passenger to their destination.

Airlines should not be allowed to offer any reduction to this penalty but could offer more in order to get passengers to deplane.  Vouchers do not count; only cash incentives should be allowed.

The penalty should apply to any size commercial flight whether it be five, ten, or 300 seats.  

Only when the penalty for over booking is truly onerous will the airlines stop this despicable practice.  I have no sympathy for the airline as 90% of the tickets they sell are non-refundable and non-cancelable; so they cannot be used and the airline gets its money. 

As to the argument that costs will increase, etc., then let the airlines sell a standby ticket which is not subject to these rules and penalties and let the consumer decide if they want to take the risk.  However, knowing how the airlines work, no more than 5% of all tickets sold nor more than 5% of total seat capacity of the flight (whichever is less) should be permitted to be sold in this special category (otherwise they would immediately sell all their seats like this to avoid the penalties.)  

Good luck.  I don't envy you up against the lawyers the airlines have on their payroll to say nothing of the pressure the airlines will exert on congress to get this watered down.

5bbbcd283895e3000163213f,92,664,"Look folks, it is simple. Airlines can't afford empty seats on expensive jets burning expensive fuel. If you increase their costs, they either have to reduce their overbooking or pay the extra fees. Either which way, they will lose more money than they already are losing. If they don't overbook, there will be more empty seats costing them revenue. What will the result be? Higher fares, even higher change ticket fees (or stop allowing change tickets altogether and if you miss the flight, oh well), airlines going out of business (less competition & more unemployment).

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,22,721,"I'm a physician, epidemiologist, and mother to a four year old boy with allergies to milk, peanuts and egg.  My son's dairy allergy is severe, and he has had numerous life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk, which required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the Emergency Department.  Tests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse, but fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut; he put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild  reaction.  

I've traveled with my children and despite calling ahead, making requests, and reminding employees at the door, I've rarely had respect, let alone consistency, in any kind of peanut-free buffer zone or flight.  Several years ago Continental Airlines customer service headquarters informed me that they would serve peanuts on all flights as they were unable to guarantee a peanut free flight.  (So why not hand out weapons since they can't guarantee a weapon free flight either?)  

I've sat with my epi pen in hand on a filthy flight with visible peanut crumbs on the floor while a flight attendant insisted on offering peanuts to the passengers around me because ""it was their right.""  

Fortunately for me, my son's peanut allergy is not severe enough that it prohibits us from air travel.  Now that he is old enough to not put things in his mouth, and to protect himself, we are safer.   However, I know of many, many others in the allergy community, children and adults who simply can NOT fly.  

My son's dairy allergy is quite severe.  The world would be a much safer place for us if no one consumed milk near him.  If his skin touches anything that once touched milk, even if it was partially cleaned, he will get severe hives.  If he consumes even less than a drop, within seconds his lips, eyes and face will swell, he will be covered in hives, vomit, and be gasping for breath.  Without epinephrine he would probably die within minutes.  But milk is ubiquitous, and milk allergy relatively uncommon, so we must protect ourselves.  Peanut allergy is common, and it is a simple step to serve an alternative peanut based snacks for a short period of time.  So why is this a big problem?

The vast majority of potential reactions would be eliminated by simply avoiding snacks that have peanuts or peanut butter as an ingredient.  Peanut oil is known to contain very little of the actual peanut protein, and would be of little risk in an airborne environment.  

As a physician, I have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance.  I am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane.  In addition, most epi-pens come in two pack doses, each of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes.  Which in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS.

I've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive, and are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety.  I think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.  Of course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face.  But I am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.  This restriction is designed to protect people with allergies from the airlines callous disregard for cleanliness and for our safety, not from our fellow passengers.

My son wanted to also write a letter.

""Hi.  My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.  I am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.  If I eat a peanut I'll get sick. I ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.  It was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.  I would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.  Everybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.""

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,10,719,"I have been watching this discussion for a couple of days now, and want to weigh in on a few issues that have been raised by both supporters and opponents of a proposed peanut ban. 

First, I find that most of the discussion has been focusing on children with allergies, and related to that, good parenting. This is certainly understandable, given the increase in peanut allergies among children. But it neglects another perspective - namely, the adult allergy sufferer. 

I've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 (and I am now in my late 20s). By the age of 6, I knew how to take my medications myself. Since the EpiPen has come out, I've carried epinephrine with me. And I've always had various other medications - e.g. inhaler - on hand. I would never expect an airline to have such medications on hand, though I would expect them to have a first-aid kit.

Opponents of the ban suggest that allergy sufferers simply avoid flying. It might be possible when the sufferer is a child - perhaps it is possible for a family to drive to grandma's house for Christmas instead of taking a plane. This depends, of course, on where grandma lives - if she lives in California, and the family lives in Maine, there might be problems.

Adults, on the other hand, travel by air for a myriad of reasons. As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one. 

Towards the end of graduate school, I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them. For offices that were far away, I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city. I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air, but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication. I've had allergies since the age of 2, so I understand that sometimes, my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others. But when I take all necessary precautions and still, my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one, because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts, isn't that a little ridiculous? Is this really a fair result? I shudder to think what life will be like when I am a ""full-fledged"" working adult. Will I have to forgo promotions because I cannot travel on peanut-laden flights? It sounds dramatic, but it's not melodramatic. The only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights.","Welcome to Regulation Room, and thank you for your comment, sbell.

It can cost well over $100 to get to an airport (for example, central NJ to JFK is about $150 and for a long vacation this is cheaper than airport parking).  When a passenger is bumped and the next available flight is the next day this can mean an additional $300+ in travel costs.","Thanks for your comment, jherbert.

Star Alliance is a big codeshare group, right? Well ... contrary to what the gate agent told me, the voucher is only good on US Airways-coded flights; and as I live in the Southwest, there's a very good chance this voucher will expire worthless.

Passengers may lack check cashing privileges away from their home airport, yet face unplanned and likely elevated expenses after being ""bumped.""   They should have a mandatory option of cash payment.  An credit card credit, if immediate, would be more secure and as useful to more passengers than either a check or cash.

The proposed compensation limits are too low to provide an incentive to the airlines to limit overbooking and may be arbitrarily unfair to certain travelers.  The Wall Street Journal recently re-proposed a 1977 proposal by the late economist Julian Simon of an auction that would offer bumped passengers a gradually rising reward for giving up their seat.  The arguments are rather compelling.

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,23,667,"As a frequent traveler and the mom of a 23 year old with multiple food allergies, I understand how complicated this type of rule making can be.  The ""rights"" of the peanut allergy sufferer are in direct conflict with the ""rights"" of the passengers that want to eat peanuts.  For many years we avoided the conflict by traveling throughout the U.S. via motorhome.  This is not a reasonalbe option for everyone since it can be very time consuming vs. flying. 
Now that my son is older and interested in traveling to Europe, we can't reasonably get there via motorhome.  We choose our airlines carefully, carry multiple Epi-pens, pack his food from home, and I pray.
It's a very scary propostion being 35,000 feet in the air over the open ocean, knowing that each Epi-pen is effective for approximately 10-15 minutes.  My son tries to sleep most of the flight and fortunately has a much larger bladder than I do.  He gets a window seat and one of us acts as his buffer to the food cart.
This is a scary and risky proposition with a 23 year old who can quickly determine his own symptoms. It would be even scarier with a young child.
The problem with peanuts and tree nuts is that they are dry and flaky so can readily become airborne.  Their oils are sticky and stubborn so can endure through a vigorous scrub with soap and water.
My son is also allergic to milk and eggs. Nobody talks about banning them because they don't have the above mentioned properties of peanuts and tree nuts.
Traveling the world is an envigorating and enlightening experience that many would argue is as important as the structured education that we experience from 12-16+ years. Many people have to travel for work and others are required to relocate to keep their employment.
Back to the question of your rights or mine.  I prefer to live in an educated, enlightened, fulfilled, and respectful society. 
If my donut is going to set off your diabetes, I will gladly forgo the donut for six to twelve to twenty four hours.  I can live without it.
Everyone can live without peanuts and tree nuts.  So let's be reasonable and let all safely travel.  Ban the nuts and see how many more families get onboard.  Airline revenues will probably go up and that's a good thing.
BTW, I've been in 6 countries in the last 6 months, so I consider myself a frequent flyer.

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,99,772,"Because an airport cabin is a confined space (with limited outside air circulation) there is a very real possibility that a person with a peanut allergy could actually die from exposure.  There is absolutely no need for other passengers to have peanuts with a total disregard for the safety (and life) of a fellow passenger.

A similar problem, that should also be addressed, along with the peanut allergy problem, is the case of allowing small domestic pets in the cabin of a aircraft.  People with allergic sensitivity to dog and cat dander are in danger of dying from an acute asthma attack.  These animals are being stored under the seat in front of the pet owner which may be directly under an asthmatic passenger.  Additionally, many pet owners do not keep these animals in their carriers for the entire flight which increases the chance of exposure. Even when there are no animals on a particular flight, their presence on previous flights (and the lack of thorough cleaning) means that their dander is still present and a hazard to asthma sufferers.  Service animals are often allowed on the seats of many flights by the cabin crews which can be deadly to an asthmatic occupying that seat on a subsequent flight.","Thank you for sharing your concerns about peanut allergies and pet dander in airport cabins.

Example: Flight delay due to mechanical problem with an anticpated wait time of 3 hours.  Technically the airline is required to compensate passengers with a meal voucher.  It's been my experience you'll get the voucher but only if you ask. Many families & individuals traveling are on a budget - that 3 hour delay can kill a budget for unexpected meals.  Airlines should be required to announce and post on the gate flight board that  passengers can claim a meal voucher during the delay.  Vouchers ahould be handy to the airliner's customer service staff at the gate.

I typically fly Southwest Airlines - a leading airline in distributing peanuts to passengers as THE ONLY SNACK on many of their flights.

I think an effective and simple solution might be to ask passengers either verbally when tickets are purchased person-to-person, or via a question prior to an e-ticket purchase that asks the traveler if they are allergic to peanuts.

6528ef6ae832d4e8fa068b19,24,787,"TELL THE TRUTH immediately, boys, and treat passengers like valued human beings. That's it. 

Southwest does it, and they have the most loyal passengers in the industry. It CAN be done, if you have the will to do it. The price SW shows online is the REAL price, not a teaser fare that shoots up rapidly when the taxes, fees, surcharges, etc. are added.  SW does not charge me nuisance fees (baggage, changing a reservation, one-way flights, etc.). If they can do it, so can the rest of you. I just wish BWI were closer to the Northern VA location I frequent, so I could use SW all the time. 

I fly at least once every week, usually between Columbus, OH and the DC area. During the past year the Sunday night delays on USAir (DCA-CMH), United (IAD-CMH), and even SW (BWI-CMH) in that order have been abismal, with delays at LEAST 30-50% of the time. When cancellations were made, passengers weren't told until 5-10 minutes before departure. These have mostly been mechanical problems (clearly avoidable with better management), crew shortages, and non-severe weather. Efficient, effective management would prevent the vast majority of these problems. 

One brief example will illustrate. On Sunday, June 13 I was scheduled on US3234 DCA-CMH at 4:55 pm. When I arrived at the gate the plane and crew were there. Good start, eh? At about 10 min. before boarding time the gate agent said they'd made a minor repair to the plane, but the paperwork had not arrived from BRAZIL! ""We'll know more in 30 minutes."" This went on until after 7 pm, at which time I re-booked for the next morning and went home. The plane did eventually fly, 3 hours late, but meanwhile I've wasted 5 hours sitting at an overheated, overcrowded, hopelessly noisy National Airport because USAir can't get paperwork faxed from BRAZIL. Why did it have to come from Brazil? Why don't they have back up plans/management solutions for such routine problems. They are bound to occur. Plan for it and head off these problems. 

During last winter's blizzards in the East, SW was the only airline that told the truth and notified us many hours in advance that flights were cancelled. United and USAir constantly insisted the flights were going, when in fact they were not.  

If the carriers want the privilege of using our air space and our public airports (supported with tax-payer subsidies), they should be held to this standard.

We must understand that other governments may not view these rules as being benign and could very well impose restrictions on US carriers. Beware the law of unforeseen consequences.

The tarmac delay problem is not caused by airlines, and in particular foreign airlines. To submit them to significant operational or financial consequences because of something outside of their control doesn't seem appropriate.

Lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the FAA and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots. Eurocontrol (the FAA's equivalent) directs European airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport (or airspace) cannot provide it's expected capacity. When this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport. In the US when 'stuff' happens it becomes the airlines problem and they have to sort it out themselves. (competition law prohibits them from discussing solutions with their competitors).

Second, either the creation of a buffer-zone or removal of peanuts base on a passenger's request is impractical. What if there are multiple allergy sufferers on the plane? Finding appropriate seat arrangements for everyone is completely impractical and time-consuming, delaying take-off. It also distracts flight attendants from completing their job. Second, among all of the other things a passenger needs to be keep in mind when traveling, notifying the airline of a peanut allergy should not be one of them. And when should the airline be notified? When is it too late to do so? And if it is too late, then what happens if someone has an allergic reaction on the plane? One possible solution is to have a little box checked off when booking a ticket to indicate a peanut allergy.

We try to avoid airlines that serve peanuts, but that is becoming more difficult in this economy where we are trying to save any where we can and airlines are merging.  We have family in Europe and used to fly Northwest with our son, however, since they have merged with Delta that is now our least expensive option (we average $2,500 - $3,500 in tickets each time we fly, so price does make a difference).  Delta serves nuts.  

My son did have a reaction on one flights.  He did not eat nuts, and neither did anyone in our row, we believe he came in contact with the nuts from someone who had sat in our seats on a previous flight.  Luckily the reaction was not severe, we could control it with medicine, but when you have a 16 month old reacting at 35,000 feet, it can be very scary.  

Then next time we flew where the airline served nuts, we told them of the allergy when we bought the tickets and when we checked in.  I felt very discriminated by a few comments we received from airline personnel.   One flight attendant got angry that he wasn't told in advance and later blamed me when he ran out of non nut snacks when asked for a bag of pretzels (they created a ""peanut free area"" around us).

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,10,719,"I have been watching this discussion for a couple of days now, and want to weigh in on a few issues that have been raised by both supporters and opponents of a proposed peanut ban. 

First, I find that most of the discussion has been focusing on children with allergies, and related to that, good parenting. This is certainly understandable, given the increase in peanut allergies among children. But it neglects another perspective - namely, the adult allergy sufferer. 

I've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 (and I am now in my late 20s). By the age of 6, I knew how to take my medications myself. Since the EpiPen has come out, I've carried epinephrine with me. And I've always had various other medications - e.g. inhaler - on hand. I would never expect an airline to have such medications on hand, though I would expect them to have a first-aid kit.

Opponents of the ban suggest that allergy sufferers simply avoid flying. It might be possible when the sufferer is a child - perhaps it is possible for a family to drive to grandma's house for Christmas instead of taking a plane. This depends, of course, on where grandma lives - if she lives in California, and the family lives in Maine, there might be problems.

Adults, on the other hand, travel by air for a myriad of reasons. As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one. 

Towards the end of graduate school, I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them. For offices that were far away, I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city. I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air, but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication. I've had allergies since the age of 2, so I understand that sometimes, my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others. But when I take all necessary precautions and still, my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one, because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts, isn't that a little ridiculous? Is this really a fair result? I shudder to think what life will be like when I am a ""full-fledged"" working adult. Will I have to forgo promotions because I cannot travel on peanut-laden flights? It sounds dramatic, but it's not melodramatic. The only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights.","Welcome to Regulation Room, and thank you for your comment, sbell.

Passengers may lack check cashing privileges away from their home airport, yet face unplanned and likely elevated expenses after being ""bumped.""

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,79,754,"I am the father of a 5-year old with a severe peanut allergy as well as a physician and a medical epidemiologist.  While I have been fortunate enough to not experience an anaphylactic reaction in my son, I have seen patients with anaphylactic reactions.  They are terrifying for everyone involved, even in situations where you are surrounded by trained staff, abundant medications and crash carts. 

The way I see this issue is that it is balancing the risks and benefits of peanuts on planes.  The risks are pretty obvious and encompass death and less severe reactions that, at a minimum, are likely to result in an emergency landing.

The benefits of serving peanuts on planes are limited to the fact that most people like peanuts and they are fairly inexpensive.

I have seen on this discussion board arguments that people have the right to eat peanuts, that people with allergies should wear masks or other personal protective equipment (extending to full body suits), that people with allergies should not fly, etc...  These arguments seem somewhat petty, impractical, and outdated, respectively.  Petty because it is not a major sacrifice to go without a bag of peanuts.  Impractical because trying to keep an N95 (particulate) mask on a young child for up to 6 hours just cannot happen.  Outdated because in modern US society with families spread across the nation travel is often the norm.

For people who say 'Just don't travel on planes', I assert that they are missing the point.  It is not as if dealing with a severe allergy is not already lifestyle altering.  I will never be able to take my son to a major league baseball park; we will never be able to go down the street for ice cream on a hot summer day; we cannot go to a Chinese restaurant.  This is all OK because these are luxuries.  Furthermore, if we somehow do find ourselves in a hazardous situation, we can just get up and leave.  On an airplane, that is not an option.  There is no getting up and leaving (and just the act of changing your seat is a challenge).

So, the way I see it is that the risks associated with serving peanuts in a closed environment where the ability to provide medical care is limited clearly outweigh the benefits of serving peanuts both on a societal and cultural level (because the very real risk faced by children and adults with severe peanut allergies far exceeds the benefit of airlines serving peanuts).

This includes airborne inhalation, cross contamination with other foods, or contact with residue left from previous and nearby passengers.  It is not simply a matter of ""don't eat it.""  It is well-known that Epipens address anaphylaxis on a SHORT TERM basis.  The effects of the Epipen last for 15 or 20 minutes, but if the medication wears off, the individual can resume their life-threatening reaction.

For almost all other foods the allergy only occurs if the food is ingested so you can easily avoid the allergic reaction but not eating the food.  This is not true for many of us with nut allergies - we react if other people are eating the food since it is an airborne allergy.  I do fly but I have to take multiple Benadryl pills every 4 hours to keep from reacting to the airborne dust of the nuts.  This works for now but I always wonder when it will no longer be enough.  An epipen is not the answer as it lasts only look enough for the plane to land which is not a practical solution when you are flying on a long flight over water and would certainly be a much greater inconvenience to the other passengers than a ban on nut products on planes if the plane was able to land.  The rules airlines have are ridiculous - Southwest is not nut free they will not serve nuts but if you fly a late flight the peanuts are all over the floor and seats.  Some other airlines have the rows around you 'nut free' but advise you they can do nothing if the person seated next to you brings nuts on and wants to eat them.  Other airlines with advance notice will not serve nuts but all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts and will not stop the person from eating them if they wish to.  So you can have a 'nut free' flight and the person sitting next to you can take out their package of peanuts and eat away - and the airlines will do nothing to help you. Again all nuts should be banned from airplanes unless it is your own private plane - then go ahead and eat what you want. ,"Thank you for sharing your personal experience and concerns about airborne nut allergies on planes.

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,65,651,"I have two children with potentially life threatening allergies to peanuts.   Unlike what one person commented, this is not a latest illness fad.  The latest research indicates that peanut allergy doubled in children from 1997 to 2002 and that number continues to increase.   It is one of the most deadly food allergies.  

The presence of nuts on planes is a real fear.  While my kids have other potentially deadly food allergies, peanuts pose a unique risk.  Nuts break into fine pieces with dust that can become airborne.    Peanut butter is sticky and gets wiped on seats and tray tables.     Even the slightest microscopic amount of nuts can create an anaphylactic reaction.  

Although EpiPens can help, they are not 100% effective and should not be considered a solution to the risk peanuts pose to allergic individuals on planes.  Additional steroids, Benadryl shots, oxygen and other medical intervention may be necessary to stop an anaphylactic reaction.    EpiPens may need to be administered every 15 to 30 minutes as well.  People still die even with intervention.

Please help protect people by offering people the opportunity to get peanut free flights or ban the sale and serving of nut products on the planes.

And it is very obvious that a consensus will not be agreed upon here.

I would like to thank the DOT for having the courage to bring this matter up and to ask for comments from the public, especially after being told by Congress in 1998 to drop the matter or risk having funding removed. No doubt the peanut lobby played a major part in that directive.

Those who have legitimate life threatening allergies (and there are many) have a right to be heard. Unfortunately, there appear to be many who wish to snuff out these voices because certain rights may be impeded.

 Congress should listen to the doctors and scientists who study these disabilities and allow the experts to make their honest recommendations. I understand that the peanut lobby will probably want their say, but money should not outweigh logic and science.

I would prefer a total ban on peanut and tree nut foods being served on flights. 

My granddaughter has been medically diagnosed as having several allergies, including these two items. We are not hysterical, and we would be much happier if these allergies could disappear or be cured. Unfortunately, the science is not there yet. So, the family must all read labels, call companies when the labels are not clear, talk with restaurants, take ""safe"" food with us when no other solution is possible, and always carry a bag with any possibly required medications. We accept these as our responsibility.

We are restricted from being able to take family vacations very far from home because of the negative attitudes of the airline companies, or lack of choices because of living next to a Delta hub. This does not affect one person, this affects 12! I would have thought that the airlines would have taken this into account when looking at their bottom dollar, but Delta has stated that they will not restrict peanuts because their home is in Georgia! 

The negative comments from some of the writers posted here are not helpful in defining what is the correct solution to allow allergy sufferers, and their families, to fly.

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,24,787,"TELL THE TRUTH immediately, boys, and treat passengers like valued human beings. That's it. 

Southwest does it, and they have the most loyal passengers in the industry. It CAN be done, if you have the will to do it. The price SW shows online is the REAL price, not a teaser fare that shoots up rapidly when the taxes, fees, surcharges, etc. are added.  SW does not charge me nuisance fees (baggage, changing a reservation, one-way flights, etc.). If they can do it, so can the rest of you. I just wish BWI were closer to the Northern VA location I frequent, so I could use SW all the time. 

I fly at least once every week, usually between Columbus, OH and the DC area. During the past year the Sunday night delays on USAir (DCA-CMH), United (IAD-CMH), and even SW (BWI-CMH) in that order have been abismal, with delays at LEAST 30-50% of the time. When cancellations were made, passengers weren't told until 5-10 minutes before departure. These have mostly been mechanical problems (clearly avoidable with better management), crew shortages, and non-severe weather. Efficient, effective management would prevent the vast majority of these problems. 

One brief example will illustrate. On Sunday, June 13 I was scheduled on US3234 DCA-CMH at 4:55 pm. When I arrived at the gate the plane and crew were there. Good start, eh? At about 10 min. before boarding time the gate agent said they'd made a minor repair to the plane, but the paperwork had not arrived from BRAZIL! ""We'll know more in 30 minutes."" This went on until after 7 pm, at which time I re-booked for the next morning and went home. The plane did eventually fly, 3 hours late, but meanwhile I've wasted 5 hours sitting at an overheated, overcrowded, hopelessly noisy National Airport because USAir can't get paperwork faxed from BRAZIL. Why did it have to come from Brazil? Why don't they have back up plans/management solutions for such routine problems. They are bound to occur. Plan for it and head off these problems. 

During last winter's blizzards in the East, SW was the only airline that told the truth and notified us many hours in advance that flights were cancelled. United and USAir constantly insisted the flights were going, when in fact they were not.  

If the carriers want the privilege of using our air space and our public airports (supported with tax-payer subsidies), they should be held to this standard.

We must understand that other governments may not view these rules as being benign and could very well impose restrictions on US carriers. Beware the law of unforeseen consequences.

The tarmac delay problem is not caused by airlines, and in particular foreign airlines. To submit them to significant operational or financial consequences because of something outside of their control doesn't seem appropriate.

Lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the FAA and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots. Eurocontrol (the FAA's equivalent) directs European airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport (or airspace) cannot provide it's expected capacity. When this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport.

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,83,635,"I have one child who is severely allergic to peanuts.  She is one of those few who react from dust, practically.  We made a decision at an early age simply not to fly.  The airlines have no cohesive, consistent policy and this issue is not something we can show up and be surprised about.

It would help children, and adults, like my daughter if the DOT banned peanuts on all flights.  Of course, asking airlines to stop serving peanuts is not enough.  The DOT would need to require that no passenger bring them aboard as well.  Let's face it, cuts to the airlines have put food at the bottom of their priority list (hence handing out ""snacks"" like peanuts).  So...if you will be flying for hours and have little prospect for food, what is the perfect protein packed food you can bring that needs no refrigeration?

I almost feel like banning peanuts would give people a false sense of security UNLESS a complete and total ban was instituted (airline & passengers).

That being said, I appreciate the argument about other allergies, as well as perfume (though I do not believe anaphylaxis is generally an issue for those allergic to perfume).  Why do we need food on board at all?  Perhaps that is a bit naive and narrow-minded, but how about a drinks-only rule?  Do 1 or 2 hours flights really need to serve ANY kind of food?  Propose that to the airlines as a cost saving measure!  (Of course, longer flights or international is a whole other ballgame.)

So, to answer the DOT questions over there <---- I would say:

1.  From empirical evidence, I believe there is a strong likelihood of a peanut allergy sufferer having a severe reaction if the conditions were right.  My daughter developed hives from peanut shell residue that had touched a banana peel.  She touched the peel to her skin and broke out in hives.  It doesn't take much.

2.  I feel strongly that people should take responsibility for themselves and, therefore, would expect all allergy sufferers to carry their own epinephrine.  However, I am under the assumption that a plane would have first aid available and possibly a defibrillator.  Adding epinephrine to this kit would only be a good business practice.

3.  I would feel (relatively) safe on a plane where peanut-ingredient products are banned from airline and passengers, but ""may contains"" were permitted.  My allergic daughter would not consume them, but the chance of her having a reaction from cross contact or inhalation are virtually nil.  Again, it's about personal responsibility.  We will take care of her food.  We just need help keeping her alive and safe from other peoples food.

667c4621604113ce1eec080c,92,664,"Look folks, it is simple. Airlines can't afford empty seats on expensive jets burning expensive fuel. If you increase their costs, they either have to reduce their overbooking or pay the extra fees. Either which way, they will lose more money than they already are losing. If they don't overbook, there will be more empty seats costing them revenue. What will the result be? Higher fares, even higher change ticket fees (or stop allowing change tickets altogether and if you miss the flight, oh well), airlines going out of business (less competition & more unemployment). In the end, the airlines are NOT going to pay these fees. The customers pay these fees. EVERYTHING flows downhill. PERIOD! The low man on the pole always loses and make no mistake but the taxpayers and customers are the bottom of the pole. 

The rules should be simple. If you kick me off my flight, I should get a refund for that flight (not round trip) and be put on the next one at no cost.

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,22,721,"I'm a physician, epidemiologist, and mother to a four year old boy with allergies to milk, peanuts and egg.  My son's dairy allergy is severe, and he has had numerous life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk, which required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the Emergency Department.  Tests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse, but fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut; he put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild  reaction.  

I've traveled with my children and despite calling ahead, making requests, and reminding employees at the door, I've rarely had respect, let alone consistency, in any kind of peanut-free buffer zone or flight.  Several years ago Continental Airlines customer service headquarters informed me that they would serve peanuts on all flights as they were unable to guarantee a peanut free flight.  (So why not hand out weapons since they can't guarantee a weapon free flight either?)  

I've sat with my epi pen in hand on a filthy flight with visible peanut crumbs on the floor while a flight attendant insisted on offering peanuts to the passengers around me because ""it was their right.""  

Fortunately for me, my son's peanut allergy is not severe enough that it prohibits us from air travel.  Now that he is old enough to not put things in his mouth, and to protect himself, we are safer.   However, I know of many, many others in the allergy community, children and adults who simply can NOT fly.  

My son's dairy allergy is quite severe.  The world would be a much safer place for us if no one consumed milk near him.  If his skin touches anything that once touched milk, even if it was partially cleaned, he will get severe hives.  If he consumes even less than a drop, within seconds his lips, eyes and face will swell, he will be covered in hives, vomit, and be gasping for breath.  Without epinephrine he would probably die within minutes.  But milk is ubiquitous, and milk allergy relatively uncommon, so we must protect ourselves.  Peanut allergy is common, and it is a simple step to serve an alternative peanut based snacks for a short period of time.  So why is this a big problem?

The vast majority of potential reactions would be eliminated by simply avoiding snacks that have peanuts or peanut butter as an ingredient.  Peanut oil is known to contain very little of the actual peanut protein, and would be of little risk in an airborne environment.  

As a physician, I have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance.  I am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane.  In addition, most epi-pens come in two pack doses, each of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes.  Which in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS.

I've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive, and are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety.  I think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.  Of course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face.  But I am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.  This restriction is designed to protect people with allergies from the airlines callous disregard for cleanliness and for our safety, not from our fellow passengers.

My son wanted to also write a letter.

""Hi.  My name is Steven.  I am 4 years old.  I am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.  If I eat a peanut I'll get sick. I ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip and it swelled up and it was hard to breathe.  It was scary and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.  I would like for them to not give out peanuts so I won't get sick because I'm allergic.  Everybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.""

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,61,695,"As the mother of a severe peanut allergic child who has had an episode on an airplane that required epinephrine I would like to stress how important it is to remove all peanuts and peanut products from the plane.

It is also important for crew to alert passengers through a public announcement and ask them not to eat peanuts that they have brought on board.

Airlines need to do what most schools today do: ban all peanut products and ban people from bringing peanuts and peanut products onto the plane. Flying is not a choice, it is often a necessity.

Second, either the creation of a buffer-zone or removal of peanuts base on a passenger's request is impractical. What if there are multiple allergy sufferers on the plane? Finding appropriate seat arrangements for everyone is completely impractical and time-consuming, delaying take-off. It also distracts flight attendants from completing their job. Second, among all of the other things a passenger needs to be keep in mind when traveling, notifying the airline of a peanut allergy should not be one of them. And when should the airline be notified? When is it too late to do so? And if it is too late, then what happens if someone has an allergic reaction on the plane? One possible solution is to have a little box checked off when booking a ticket to indicate a peanut allergy. But given the myriad of ways in which tickets are booked and purchased today, this is unlikely to be completely successful. The most practical solution is to just ban them on flights. The decision is not based on the risk to allergy and non-allergy passengers, but the costs of different solutions.","I appreciate your personal experience and concerns as a peanut allergy sufferer.

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,10,719,"I have been watching this discussion for a couple of days now, and want to weigh in on a few issues that have been raised by both supporters and opponents of a proposed peanut ban. 

First, I find that most of the discussion has been focusing on children with allergies, and related to that, good parenting. This is certainly understandable, given the increase in peanut allergies among children. But it neglects another perspective - namely, the adult allergy sufferer. 

I've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 (and I am now in my late 20s). By the age of 6, I knew how to take my medications myself. Since the EpiPen has come out, I've carried epinephrine with me. And I've always had various other medications - e.g. inhaler - on hand. I would never expect an airline to have such medications on hand, though I would expect them to have a first-aid kit.

Opponents of the ban suggest that allergy sufferers simply avoid flying. It might be possible when the sufferer is a child - perhaps it is possible for a family to drive to grandma's house for Christmas instead of taking a plane. This depends, of course, on where grandma lives - if she lives in California, and the family lives in Maine, there might be problems.

Adults, on the other hand, travel by air for a myriad of reasons. As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one. 

Towards the end of graduate school, I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them. For offices that were far away, I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city. I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air, but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication. I've had allergies since the age of 2, so I understand that sometimes, my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others. But when I take all necessary precautions and still, my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one, because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts, isn't that a little ridiculous? Is this really a fair result? I shudder to think what life will be like when I am a ""full-fledged"" working adult. Will I have to forgo promotions because I cannot travel on peanut-laden flights? It sounds dramatic, but it's not melodramatic. The only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights.","Welcome to Regulation Room, and thank you for your comment, sbell.

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,79,754,"I am the father of a 5-year old with a severe peanut allergy as well as a physician and a medical epidemiologist.  While I have been fortunate enough to not experience an anaphylactic reaction in my son, I have seen patients with anaphylactic reactions.  They are terrifying for everyone involved, even in situations where you are surrounded by trained staff, abundant medications and crash carts. 

The way I see this issue is that it is balancing the risks and benefits of peanuts on planes.  The risks are pretty obvious and encompass death and less severe reactions that, at a minimum, are likely to result in an emergency landing.

The benefits of serving peanuts on planes are limited to the fact that most people like peanuts and they are fairly inexpensive.

I have seen on this discussion board arguments that people have the right to eat peanuts, that people with allergies should wear masks or other personal protective equipment (extending to full body suits), that people with allergies should not fly, etc...  These arguments seem somewhat petty, impractical, and outdated, respectively.  Petty because it is not a major sacrifice to go without a bag of peanuts.  Impractical because trying to keep an N95 (particulate) mask on a young child for up to 6 hours just cannot happen.  Outdated because in modern US society with families spread across the nation travel is often the norm.

For people who say 'Just don't travel on planes', I assert that they are missing the point.  It is not as if dealing with a severe allergy is not already lifestyle altering.  I will never be able to take my son to a major league baseball park; we will never be able to go down the street for ice cream on a hot summer day; we cannot go to a Chinese restaurant.  This is all OK because these are luxuries.  Furthermore, if we somehow do find ourselves in a hazardous situation, we can just get up and leave.  On an airplane, that is not an option.  There is no getting up and leaving (and just the act of changing your seat is a challenge).

So, the way I see it is that the risks associated with serving peanuts in a closed environment where the ability to provide medical care is limited clearly outweigh the benefits of serving peanuts both on a societal and cultural level (because the very real risk faced by children and adults with severe peanut allergies far exceeds the benefit of airlines serving peanuts).

If a passenger is bumped from a flight and misses an important business meeting, high school graduation or wedding, there is no price that can compensate for that. Certainly not $1300.  In addition, even if the entire flight fare is refunded (easily over $1300 on some long overseas flights), there are other costs that the bumped passenger could face such as non-refundable/prepaid hotel reservations or other travel and travel related expenses.  If a passenger can prove that he or she has additional expense above and beyond what the airline offers and the government requires he or she should be awarded more compensation. 



As for zero-fare tickets, for the same reasons above, I do not think compensating them with just miles is adequate.

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,87,639,"I have a young son who is beyond Class 6 (highest class)for peanuts/tree nuts. For him, it simply is not a matter of ""passing up"" on a snack.  Anaphylaxis can happen much more readily for him by the transfer of oils (peanut oils on airline tray tables, arm rests). It can also happen by airborne dust.  In a flight where peanuts are being served and all 100+ bags go POOF at the same time they are opened - well, let's just say it would be a mother's nightmare.  Especialy with recycled cabin air.  Even without a peanut allergy, peanuts are just such a choking hazard for any small children.  Why serve them?  There are plenty of reasonable alternatives.  I recall when my son was first diagnosed, 1 week prior to Christmas.  Our pediatrician called us at all of our nighttime emergency numbers just to ensure we wouldn't step onto any holiday airline flights without an epi-pen and proper documentation of his condition.  I was FLOORED to f sind out that Delta still served peanuts.  Really??  Peanut allergy is unlike some other food allergies in that there are multiple ways to have reaction (ingestion, touching, breathing).  My suggestion would be to ban peanut products on all airlines.  But that still does not/will  not control what snacks others bring on.  So I would suggest they still offer peanut free buffer zones and have some method of ensuring passengers in those rows are aware of what that means (don't bring or open peanut snacks). I also think that pre-boarding should be an option, so that peanut families can go and wipe down the tray tables/arm rests themselves and feel comfortable with the environment in which their child will be sitting. I've been on one too many flights were peanuts have been banned simply due to an allergic person flying...and I feel SO MUCH sympathy for those families, because the airline staff does not seem to be good at respecting their privacy. In fact, they almost act begruding or point out the poor child to other.  What kid wants to be labeled?  In all honesty, I can't see making the switch to peanut free snacks to be that big an impact to the airlines. As long as items are clearly labeled (most, not all pretzels) are o.k.  If nothing else, I am so very appreciative that this issue is gaining attention.  I don't think airlines realize how many passengers don't fly them due to their poor policies. In fact, I learned so much already today reading these message boards. I will make it a point to frequent the airlines (that serve my area) where people seem to have had really positive and supportive environments when flying with their children.  Great info for me to have as a parent.   I also wonder if you couldn't look into how the major sports arenas handle peanut allergies.  Most will offer at least one ""peanut free"" day so that children can enjoy major league sports like baseball etc.  So it can be done.

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,65,651,"I have two children with potentially life threatening allergies to peanuts.   Unlike what one person commented, this is not a latest illness fad.  The latest research indicates that peanut allergy doubled in children from 1997 to 2002 and that number continues to increase.   It is one of the most deadly food allergies.  

The presence of nuts on planes is a real fear.  While my kids have other potentially deadly food allergies, peanuts pose a unique risk.  Nuts break into fine pieces with dust that can become airborne.    Peanut butter is sticky and gets wiped on seats and tray tables.     Even the slightest microscopic amount of nuts can create an anaphylactic reaction.  

Although EpiPens can help, they are not 100% effective and should not be considered a solution to the risk peanuts pose to allergic individuals on planes.  Additional steroids, Benadryl shots, oxygen and other medical intervention may be necessary to stop an anaphylactic reaction.    EpiPens may need to be administered every 15 to 30 minutes as well.  People still die even with intervention.

Please help protect people by offering people the opportunity to get peanut free flights or ban the sale and serving of nut products on the planes.

I would like to thank the DOT for having the courage to bring this matter up and to ask for comments from the public, especially after being told by Congress in 1998 to drop the matter or risk having funding removed. No doubt the peanut lobby played a major part in that directive.

Those who have legitimate life threatening allergies (and there are many) have a right to be heard. Unfortunately, there appear to be many who wish to snuff out these voices because certain rights may be impeded.

 Congress should listen to the doctors and scientists who study these disabilities and allow the experts to make their honest recommendations. I understand that the peanut lobby will probably want their say, but money should not outweigh logic and science.

My granddaughter has been medically diagnosed as having several allergies, including these two items. We are not hysterical, and we would be much happier if these allergies could disappear or be cured. Unfortunately, the science is not there yet. So, the family must all read labels, call companies when the labels are not clear, talk with restaurants, take ""safe"" food with us when no other solution is possible, and always carry a bag with any possibly required medications.

We must understand that other governments may not view these rules as being benign and could very well impose restrictions on US carriers. Beware the law of unforeseen consequences.

The tarmac delay problem is not caused by airlines, and in particular foreign airlines. To submit them to significant operational or financial consequences because of something outside of their control doesn't seem appropriate.

Lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the FAA and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots. Eurocontrol (the FAA's equivalent) directs European airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport (or airspace) cannot provide it's expected capacity. When this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport.

Example, I have terminals nationwide. I take a load from California, move it to my terminal within my SH limits drop it and another truck picks it up and does the same thing.  By doing this I can get a load across American faster than a LH company, Because some of my ""short Haul"" drivers will be able to cheat their logs. You have now created an unlevel playing field between the SH and LH companies.   ","Thanks for your comment, jfleeman.

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,83,635,"I have one child who is severely allergic to peanuts.  She is one of those few who react from dust, practically.  We made a decision at an early age simply not to fly.  The airlines have no cohesive, consistent policy and this issue is not something we can show up and be surprised about.

It would help children, and adults, like my daughter if the DOT banned peanuts on all flights.  Of course, asking airlines to stop serving peanuts is not enough.  The DOT would need to require that no passenger bring them aboard as well.  Let's face it, cuts to the airlines have put food at the bottom of their priority list (hence handing out ""snacks"" like peanuts).  So...if you will be flying for hours and have little prospect for food, what is the perfect protein packed food you can bring that needs no refrigeration?

I almost feel like banning peanuts would give people a false sense of security UNLESS a complete and total ban was instituted (airline & passengers).

That being said, I appreciate the argument about other allergies, as well as perfume (though I do not believe anaphylaxis is generally an issue for those allergic to perfume).  Why do we need food on board at all?  Perhaps that is a bit naive and narrow-minded, but how about a drinks-only rule?  Do 1 or 2 hours flights really need to serve ANY kind of food?  Propose that to the airlines as a cost saving measure!  (Of course, longer flights or international is a whole other ballgame.)

So, to answer the DOT questions over there <---- I would say:

1.  From empirical evidence, I believe there is a strong likelihood of a peanut allergy sufferer having a severe reaction if the conditions were right.  My daughter developed hives from peanut shell residue that had touched a banana peel.  She touched the peel to her skin and broke out in hives.  It doesn't take much.

2.  I feel strongly that people should take responsibility for themselves and, therefore, would expect all allergy sufferers to carry their own epinephrine.  However, I am under the assumption that a plane would have first aid available and possibly a defibrillator.  Adding epinephrine to this kit would only be a good business practice.

3.  I would feel (relatively) safe on a plane where peanut-ingredient products are banned from airline and passengers, but ""may contains"" were permitted.  My allergic daughter would not consume them, but the chance of her having a reaction from cross contact or inhalation are virtually nil.  Again, it's about personal responsibility.  We will take care of her food.  We just need help keeping her alive and safe from other peoples food.

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,77,654,"Make the compensation exactly what it is intended to be...the cost (or double the cost) of the ticket, no cap since there is no cap on how much you may pay for that ticket. 
Frequent flyer miles should simply be refunded or a double amount refunded in the same way as a cash ticket is handled. Keep this simple and it will work much better.
On smaller flights, use the same rules. Again, keep it simple.
Best way to give passengers information is to post it online, on a legible sign in the gate area, and in print large enough to read on tickets. If people won't take the time to read at least one of those sources then they only have themselves to blame for not knowing about this.","Welcome to Regulation Room, gmt512, and thank you for your comment.

63e5356ce15946b456f4740d,92,664,"Look folks, it is simple. Airlines can't afford empty seats on expensive jets burning expensive fuel. If you increase their costs, they either have to reduce their overbooking or pay the extra fees. Either which way, they will lose more money than they already are losing. If they don't overbook, there will be more empty seats costing them revenue. What will the result be? Higher fares, even higher change ticket fees (or stop allowing change tickets altogether and if you miss the flight, oh well), airlines going out of business (less competition & more unemployment). In the end, the airlines are NOT going to pay these fees. The customers pay these fees. EVERYTHING flows downhill. PERIOD! The low man on the pole always loses and make no mistake but the taxpayers and customers are the bottom of the pole. 

The rules should be simple. If you kick me off my flight, I should get a refund for that flight (not round trip) and be put on the next one at no cost. I've personally never been on a flight where people didn't just volunteer based on the airlines' attempt to bride passengers.","Welcome to Regulation Room and thank you for commenting, hotblazer.
