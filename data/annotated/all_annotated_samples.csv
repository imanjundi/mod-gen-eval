Air travel has turned into such a frustrating exercise (hidden fees, late flights, no water, no food, no service) that we look for reasons not to go air. Frankly, if I have to live with such delays, I'd just as soon do it on a train. THEY are still fun, despite their delays.

I fly extensively in the US and internationally.  And, in reading all the comments posted thus far, for the most part, there appears to be a lot of emotion and not a lot of facts surrounding this issue.
   The airlines should not be banning any food and they certainly should not be come the food police.
  I strongly urge the DOT to get more scientic-based information.  Any disability needs to be treated with sensitivity. However, i want to point out that when we installed ramps for those in a wheel chairs, we did not remove the stairs.
  Some facts to consider.  studies show that you cannot have a serious/deadly reaction to peanut, tree nut,  or other food allergy protein by smelling it; despite what some of the contributors here have said.  Less than 1% of the population has a peanut allergy and not all of those are ""severly"" allergic. (Compare that with the exponentially higher incidence of diabetes--diabetics need plant based proteins like peanuts during flights to keep their blood sugar levels under control.) or, a milk allergy which is far more prevelent.
  Airborne exposure will not affect the body systemically, so therefore cannot cause anaphylaxis. If extremely allergic, you may have some symptoms like sneezing, running nose and coughing. For those peanut or tree nut allergic, and for all food allergies, you MUST ingest the food protein to have a systemtic reaction. And, even with direct skin contact to tree nuts, peanuts or peanut and nut butters, most allergic people will not show signs of a reaction, or it so it will be a localized minor one such as hives, or a welt.
   You can, however, have a psyhcosomatic reaction to anything you are afraid of.  Peanut allergy has become an exaggerated fear to the detriment of those who suffer from other food allergies and other serious and chronic diseases.
   A few Facts:  more than 3,000 kids die from asthma each year; 10,000 kids go to the hospital each year with brain injuries due to sports; 45,000 kids die in car accidents. Last time i saw a statisic on food allergy fatalities it was aobut 100 to 150 over a five year period for all foods.  This is not to say that peanut and tree nut allergies, or any allergy is not serious. They are.
  But I wonder if these same parents who are demandting that peanuts and tree nuts be banned from everywhere are asking for sports be eliminated from school programs, or if their children are being kept out of sports. or, have they given up driving their children in a car; or, will they get their son or daughter a drivers license at age 16.
  i have a friend whose child almost died twice from a serious allergy to milk because people think milk allergy can't be fatal; they confuse milk allergy with lactose intolerance because the hysteria created by some about peanut has drowned out any sense of reason and overshadowed everyone else's issues.  A recent widely publicized study showed that far more people think they have food allergies than actually do. Again, i am not minimizing those who do, but a food allergy needs to be diagnosed by a certified immunologist who conducts a food challenge. Then and only then does a patient really know what they are allergic to. and, a food allergy is very different than a food sensitivity.   Many people have multiple food allergies, but once properly diagnosed that person needs to be taught to care for themselves and take all necessary precautions.
   Also, I read in the news is that patients with egg and food allergy have now been de-sensitized in clinical settings with guess what?  egg and peanut!  so, let's rid ourselves of the hysteria.  let's stop our demanding and outrageousness and let's call for ome common sense.  i fear for these children that are being raised by parents to live in fear of the ""bogey man"".  instead of teaching them to handle whatever afflication they have in a responsible and calm manner--whether it's severe asthma, other food allergies, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and the hundreds of other afflications that so many of us live with everyday.
   I myself have a food allergy so i truly understand what it takes to be vigliant; it isn't easy.
   in all my years of flying and with all the different carriers i have been on, i find that whether in the US or abroad, without legislation, they try to be as accommodating as possible when people plan ahead and are not behaving rudely.
   we have more than enough regulation and every time a new regulation comes along it always carries unintended consequences.  so, once you ban peanuts and tree nuts, will you prohibit seeing eye dogs on flights for those of us who are severly allergic?  Remember, you can die from an asthma attack caused by a reaction to an animal. or, will you have a voice of reason and talk with the carrier, check on your medications, where a highly refined mask and take the right precautions.
   My own near fatal experience to a different allergy reinforced for me that if you demand the world conform to you, you will become lax making it more likely you will have an accidenta encounter.  we need to be prepared and proactive, not create a bubble around ourselves and our children.
    ",Thank you for sharing your extensive experience and providing factual information on food allergies.

It is a closed space. I am allergic to peanuts and almonds and I am impacted every time I fly.  A nut free zone does not work since the dust from nuts gets in the closed air system of the plane.  For the time that people are on planes there should be consideration of others who have no control as to the reactions they have to nuts.  For almost all other foods the allergy only occurs if the food is ingested so you can easily avoid the allergic reaction but not eating the food.  This is not true for many of us with nut allergies - we react if other people are eating the food since it is an airborne allergy.

The rules airlines have are ridiculous - Southwest is not nut free they will not serve nuts but if you fly a late flight the peanuts are all over the floor and seats.  Some other airlines have the rows around you 'nut free' but advise you they can do nothing if the person seated next to you brings nuts on and wants to eat them.  Other airlines with advance notice will not serve nuts but all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts and will not stop the person from eating them if they wish to.  So you can have a 'nut free' flight and the person sitting next to you can take out their package of peanuts and eat away - and the airlines will do nothing to help you.

Well then what caused that thing? Say we find the cause for that thing. What caused that cause? Unless you have an infinite regression of causes, I don't understand how there couldn't inevitably be a first cause that has no prior causes, and thus just exists with no explanation whatsoever. Even if there were an infinite regression of causes, it seems to me that this still wouldn't avoid the problem. We would still need to explain why the infinite regression existed in the first place (although ""first place"" in this sense doesn't mean in the actual chronological sense, but in more overall sense). So no matter what, it seems that there must be some first thing that is just there for no reason and with no cause. Please change my view.","Fascinating perspective!

While there are collection agencies that abuse consumers and the system, and need to be dealt with, most agencies are simply trying to help collect monies due their clients from consumers who have chosen not to pay.  There could be a variety of reasons that they've chosen not to pay; both legit and not legit.

Currently, the playing field favors consumers; more specifically 'consumer attorneys'.  Collection agencies can get sued for leaving a message for a consumer WITHOUT disclosing that they owe a debt because uninformed judges have arbitrarily decided that a message that does not disclose any information about a debt is a communication.   This completely contradicts current FDCPA law, however, that specifically states that a 'communication' means directly conveying information regarding a debt.

They can also get sued by leaving a 'Foti' message, should that message be overheard by a 3rd party.   'Foti' is NOT law, but rather another judge's uneducated (on FDCPA) opinion / ruling that basically states that 'messages need to give complete information about a consumer debt and that the call is from a collection agency, after allowing unrelated 3rd parties the opportunity to step away from the message retrieval device.  This sounds silly, but it's true.

Predatory consumer attorneys use this lack of definition in the law to perform 'Sue and Settle' techniques on collection agencies that make call attempts in one of the above stated procedures; agencies can get sued for trying to contact debtors by both methods.

What's worse, and I personally know consumers that this has happened to, is that these 'supposed' consumer attorneys aren't really acting on behalf of the consumers that they represent.  They use these consumers simply as a 'vehicle' to sue an agency where their whole goal is to get thousands of SETTLEMENT dollars in attorney fees as they can while only providing the alleged 'wronged' consumer several hundreds of dollars.  They use this 'SUE & SETTLE' business model as a way of extorting money from agencies because they know that an agency would have to spend $30-50K to defend themselves.  And, while the agency may be successful in defending themselves, many don't have the monies to spend defending themselves knowing that they cannot recoup these fees & costs from the consumer attorney that filed the frivolous lawsuit in the first place.

Furthermore, somewhere along the way, another uninformed judge made a ruling (NOT LAW) stating that agencies can be sued under TCPA by attempting to contact a consumer about their debt by an auto-dialer calling the consumer's cell phone.

Several things are wrong with this.  First, if you read the TCPA in it's entirety, it was meant to stop TELEPHONE SOLICITORS (people trying to sell consumers something), that didn't have any prior relationship with the consumer.  Collection agencies are not trying to sell anything.  Collection agencies, via BA Agreements, act as an extension of the business office for those creditors that DO HAVE A PRIOR RELATIONSHIP with consumers.  As such, the TCPA does not apply.  However, judges that are ignorant on the law make their opinion into a ruling which opens the doors for these predator attorneys to use their 'Sue & Settle' techniques.

In conclusion, the CFPB needs to specifically define HOW collection agencies can lawfully contact, and work with, those consumers that owe their clients money.  The CFPB needs to 'throw out' ignorant rulings by judges who do not understand the law.

The laws have to be equal on both sides.  If not, the CFPB will simply provide consumers a legal avenue to steal from those businesses that they do credit business with by not paying their bills and, subsequently, these businesses not being able to hire debt collectors to help them get the money that they're owed.","Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the importance of fair rules for both debt collectors and consumers.

Can you share more about the types of companies or industries you've worked in where this was the case? Additionally, do you think there are any potential drawbacks to not requiring a reason for sick days, and how might that impact workplace dynamics?"

Yes, you are fortunate.  For some people (my son) the life-threatening reaction of airway constriction is immediate.  I couldn't carry enough Epi-pens to allow the plane time enough to land so that we could get to an ER where a doctor--not a nurse--could save his life.  I'm not an expert like you, but last I heard death by suffocation takes a mere 9 minutes.  It would be good business for the airlines to voluntarily do everything they can to avoid re-directing aircraft due to an emergency and ruining everyone's very important trip to Cancun.  Perhaps they have contracts with Planter's?

Your concern about religious people requesting further bans on food reveals a lot about you. I'll quell your fears with this:  My son is not offended by peanuts nor do I have a book that says he shouldn't eat them; peanuts could kill him.  It is a scientifically proven fact that anaphylaxis exists and can kill after peanut exposure. Someone above likened this to the Boogey Man, but if I give my son a peanut, he could die (and almost has); everytime I look under his bed for the Boogey Man, there's nothing.  It's pretty reliable data.

Let life and death be the standard for what foods to ban, and no one should have a problem with this issue.  I didn't know that there was a sizable peanut lobby, nor that so many Americans tie their rights, freedom, and understanding of Capitalism to their ability to eat peanuts.  But I've always known that they love to tie their prejudices to matters they don't understand, and this board is proof of the reason WHY the government resorts to making laws that should be common sense and decency.","Computer_Forensics_Expert and Immunoglobulin, thank you for your comments.

It's interesting that you bring up the issue of personal space. Can you elaborate on what you mean by 'gaming the bumping system'? How do you think the DOT's role could impact your travel experiences? What specific changes would you like to see in terms of in-air convenience or pricing practices?

Airlines should NOT be able to overbook flights on Domestic, Regional or International flights!!! This alone would put a huge dent in the UNFAIR practice of bumping passengers who expect the airline to get them to their destination in time and on the right flight. It is very inconvenient to have to contact friends and family at your destination that you will be arriving late or not at all because you were bumped.

Example: Flight delay due to mechanical problem with an anticpated wait time of 3 hours.  Technically the airline is required to compensate passengers with a meal voucher.  It's been my experience you'll get the voucher but only if you ask. Many families & individuals traveling are on a budget - that 3 hour delay can kill a budget for unexpected meals.  Airlines should be required to announce and post on the gate flight board that  passengers can claim a meal voucher during the delay.  Vouchers ahould be handy to the airliner's customer service staff at the gate.

It's all about establishing systems that are clear and protocol is established.  That means if a flight is delayed longer than 3 hours or a passenger is bumped as system is in place that is tranparent to airline personell and airline customers.

As someone that once logged 100+ flights per year for many years, I have experienced both the best and the worst of what air travel can provide.

I would like to offer some insights that hopefully will expand the scope of the regulation you are considering vis-à-vis airline-passenger communication.  From a passenger perspective, I believe there are actually three deficiencies that drive the current communication problem, and resulting shortcomings in the system:  (1) There is a major disconnect in information between gate agents and reservation agents; (2) There is no prompt communication between the airline and the passenger (as you correctly note here); and (3) There is no way to guarantee re-booking or re-routing, without penalty, without going to the airport.  As a result, even when there is a high likelihood that a flight will be canceled, passengers go to the airport, often at significant expense, then must wait in long lines, causing havoc inside the airport, and creating the inefficient system that we are all familiar with.  I believe these three together are the source of the problem and would like to illustrate this with a brief example:

This winter, I had a vacation booked to Colorado to ski.  On the day of travel there was heavy snow in New York City.  To me it was obvious that my flight would be canceled.  However, despite repeated calls to the airline, I was assured that the flight was showing to depart on-time (Problems 1 and 2).  However, knowing that if the flight did leave, even if that were 5 hours later, I would face a steep re-booking expense (change fee plus fare difference!), I went to the airport regardless (Problem 3).  Upon arrival at the airport, and after checking my skis curbside, my fears were of course confirmed, the flight had been canceled, and there were long lines at all of the agent counters and the gates.  I then waited in line for an hour, re-booked, waited another hour to collect my bag, and returned home.  The monetary expense for me was $150 in cab rides and tips, and 5 hours in time, and one day of lost skiing.  None of which was claimable/reimbursable.

So, I would like to suggest oversight/regulation of the following:  (1) Airlines should be required to invest in systems that streamline information so that information among their reservations agents is as current as it is at the gate; (2) In addition to notifying passengers about their flight promptly (30 minutes sounds reasonable), there should be earlier, and more frequent communication about overall ""Airport Health"" on the day of travel.  For example, just letting a passenger know about his/her flight in advance does not necessarily help at all.  If that communication comes less than 90 minutes before departure, it is outside of the window in which a passenger can react:  he/she is already on the way to the airport.  However, if an earlier communication were:  ""Due to heavy snow, all flights this morning have been departing 1-2 hours behind schedule.  Please prepare for delays/possibility of cancellation.  We will provide another status update in one hour.""  This is a communication that a passenger can thoughtfully incorporate into his/her planning.  Finally, (3) Rules should be developed defining the conditions under which a passenger can rebook without charge.  Perhaps if the flight is going to be delayed more than 3 hours, it is better for the passenger and the airline to let a passenger rebook.  Sometimes the flight is overbooked anyway.

I believe further consideration of the above collectively would result in a far better passenger experience, and more efficient airline management.  Thank you for considering my input.  RK","Thanks for your thoughts Keiserrgx.

One question DOT asks is what method carriers should use for their updates. Since it seems you fly often, how would you like to receive information updates? Do you think all carriers should use a single method?

So, I would like to suggest oversight/regulation of the following:  (1) Airlines should be required to invest in systems that streamline information so that information among their reservations agents is as current as it is at the gate; (2) In addition to notifying passengers about their flight promptly (30 minutes sounds reasonable), there should be earlier, and more frequent communication about overall ""Airport Health"" on the day of travel.  For example, just letting a passenger know about his/her flight in advance does not necessarily help at all.  If that communication comes less than 90 minutes before departure, it is outside of the window in which a passenger can react:  he/she is already on the way to the airport.  However, if an earlier communication were:  ""Due to heavy snow, all flights this morning have been departing 1-2 hours behind schedule.  Please prepare for delays/possibility of cancellation.  We will provide another status update in one hour.""  This is a communication that a passenger can thoughtfully incorporate into his/her planning.  Finally, (3) Rules should be developed defining the conditions under which a passenger can rebook without charge.  Perhaps if the flight is going to be delayed more than 3 hours, it is better for the passenger and the airline to let a passenger rebook.  Sometimes the flight is overbooked anyway.

I believe further consideration of the above collectively would result in a far better passenger experience, and more efficient airline management.  Thank you for considering my input.  RK","Thanks for your thoughts Keiserrgx.

One question DOT asks is what method carriers should use for their updates. Since it seems you fly often, how would you like to receive information updates? Do you think all carriers should use a single method?

What do others think? Are Keiserrgx's problems faced by others?   "

In regards to medicines, someone mentioned earlier about a defibrillator being on board. They are prepared for heart problems but a child's first reaction to peanuts is just as likely and deadly, so maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to have one. Although, I can't imagine someone with a peanut allergy coming on board without their medicines.
On a side note, someone commented about how this would only effect 1% of the population. I'm not sure about that number. But, I do know that out my family of 5, NONE of us can fly with my child... so not only does my son not fly, but we don't. I would venture to say that this is the same case for most families.

Given the concerns expressed regarding singling out allergic passengers, does anyone have a suggestion for the best way to inform passengers of the need to refrain from peanut consumption?
Should this be a part of the rule? Should it be up to the airlines? Should there be announcements to passengers? Should this be part of the rule?

DOT asked, ""How likely it is that a passenger with a severe peanut allergy will suffer a reaction from peanut particles in the air on a flight?""
While I am no expert, I believe that a variety of simulations could empirically address this issue. One would need to determine the required concentration of airborne particles to spark an allergic reaction in the most medically sensitive individual - thereby setting the threshold level of airborne peanut particulate. That said, as other commenters have noted, airborne peanut particulate is not the sole cause of an allergic reaction.
I do, however, take issue with the phrasing of this question. Clearly, the genesis of the question is that allergic reactions to peanuts can be fatal. The question should address *potentially fatal* allergic reactions. This brings us to DOT's next question...

DOT asked: ""What steps should airlines have to take, if any, to avoid this danger?""
If the danger being addressed is any and all allergic peanut reaction, the answer is ""none."" If the danger being addressed is a *potentially fatal* allergic reaction, airlines should stop serving peanuts and contributing to a potentially dangerous environment. However, an outright restriction on what passengers may be permitted to bring on board is excessive and, potentially, unenforceable. Would gate agents be required to inspect passengers' snack items to ensure that they do not contain peanuts? Transportation security challenges are already too great to include enforcement of a ban on all peanut products. Furthermore, it is unreasonable to assume that the average citizen is fully aware of the peanut content (or made-in-a-factory-that-processes-peanuts labeling) of their snack items. No all-out ban will fully eliminate a potentially fatal environment, and DOT should not encourage such a false sense of security to those travelers who might be concerned about this matter.
If the study outlined in my first response yielded a reasonable ppm threshold of peanut particulate, DOT could work with airlines and airliner manufacturers to install the appropriate systems that would alert passengers to the risk as well as neutralize that risk.

DOT asked, ""Would an epinephrine auto-injector, to allow immediate treatment of an allergic reaction, be sufficient? If so, should it be the responsibility of the airline, or the passenger, to provide it?""
I cannot answer the first part. As for the second part, airlines already carry portable defibrilators. Carrying EpiPens would not be an undue burden. Airlines, however, should expect that passengers or parents would carry their own EpiPens. Airlines should not be expected to administer EpiPen treatments to unaccompanied children, and children with such allergies should not be permitted to fly unaccompanied.

DOT asked, ""Should any food item containing peanuts be covered in a restriction, including e.g., peanut butter crackers and products containing peanut oil?""
See above: airlines should not contribute to an environment that endangers their passengers. However, passenger choices should not be restricted, if reasonable assurance can be given that passenger food/snack choices do not contribute to a potentially fatal environment.","Thank you for your thoughtful and detailed comment on airline passenger rights. You've raised important points about the complexity of addressing peanut allergies on flights. To further explore this issue, can you elaborate on what you mean by'reasonable assurance' that passenger food choices don't contribute to a potentially fatal environment? How would you envision this being implemented in practice?"

DOT asked, ""How likely it is that a passenger with a severe peanut allergy will suffer a reaction from peanut particles in the air on a flight?""
While I am no expert, I believe that a variety of simulations could empirically address this issue. One would need to determine the required concentration of airborne particles to spark an allergic reaction in the most medically sensitive individual - thereby setting the threshold level of airborne peanut particulate. That said, as other commenters have noted, airborne peanut particulate is not the sole cause of an allergic reaction.

670,63d7ac4c9acdaa357a0ae2d3,59,719,3.0,481.0,Airline Passenger Rights,regroom_gen,5,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,False,"I have been watching this discussion for a couple of days now, and want to weigh in on a few issues that have been raised by both supporters and opponents of a proposed peanut ban.

First, I find that most of the discussion has been focusing on children with allergies, and related to that, good parenting. This is certainly understandable, given the increase in peanut allergies among children. But it neglects another perspective - namely, the adult allergy sufferer.

I've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 (and I am now in my late 20s). By the age of 6, I knew how to take my medications myself. Since the EpiPen has come out, I've carried epinephrine with me. And I've always had various other medications - e.g. inhaler - on hand. I would never expect an airline to have such medications on hand, though I would expect them to have a first-aid kit.

Opponents of the ban suggest that allergy sufferers simply avoid flying. It might be possible when the sufferer is a child - perhaps it is possible for a family to drive to grandma's house for Christmas instead of taking a plane. This depends, of course, on where grandma lives - if she lives in California, and the family lives in Maine, there might be problems.

Adults, on the other hand, travel by air for a myriad of reasons. As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one.

Towards the end of graduate school, I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them. For offices that were far away, I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city. I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air, but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication. I've had allergies since the age of 2, so I understand that sometimes, my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others. But when I take all necessary precautions and still, my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one, because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts, isn't that a little ridiculous? Is this really a fair result? I shudder to think what life will be like when I am a ""full-fledged"" working adult. Will I have to forgo promotions because I cannot travel on peanut-laden flights? It sounds dramatic, but it's not melodramatic.

First, I find that most of the discussion has been focusing on children with allergies, and related to that, good parenting. This is certainly understandable, given the increase in peanut allergies among children. But it neglects another perspective - namely, the adult allergy sufferer.

I've had a moderate to severe peanut allergy since the age of 2 (and I am now in my late 20s). By the age of 6, I knew how to take my medications myself. Since the EpiPen has come out, I've carried epinephrine with me. And I've always had various other medications - e.g. inhaler - on hand. I would never expect an airline to have such medications on hand, though I would expect them to have a first-aid kit.

Opponents of the ban suggest that allergy sufferers simply avoid flying. It might be possible when the sufferer is a child - perhaps it is possible for a family to drive to grandma's house for Christmas instead of taking a plane. This depends, of course, on where grandma lives - if she lives in California, and the family lives in Maine, there might be problems.

Adults, on the other hand, travel by air for a myriad of reasons. As a graduate student, I studied at a university eight hours from home. A few months ago, there was a family emergency at home. My choices were to drive eight hours, thereby possibly ending after a loved one had already passed, or to brave a flight with peanuts on board but that would take considerably less time. I chose the flight, taking all sorts of precautions including informing the flight attendants of my allergy. They created a ""peanut-free zone"" around me, serving pretzels to the passengers sitting four rows in front of me and four rows behind me. I still had a mild reaction (no use of the EpiPen, in other words, but still heavily medicated by the time I left the plane), so that when I did arrive at the hospital, I had to undergo treatment myself before visiting my loved one.

Towards the end of graduate school, I applied to a number of jobs all over the US and was granted interviews at many of them. For offices that were far away, I chose the interviews that I did accept and attend based on whether a peanut-free airline was available to fly into that city. I feared not only a severe allergic reaction in air, but also any repercussions that could carry over to my interview once I had taken medication. I've had allergies since the age of 2, so I understand that sometimes, my ability to engage in certain activities is more limited than others. But when I take all necessary precautions and still, my job prospects are limited or I fail to see a dying loved one, because an airline obstinately refuses to serve peanuts, isn't that a little ridiculous? Is this really a fair result? I shudder to think what life will be like when I am a ""full-fledged"" working adult. Will I have to forgo promotions because I cannot travel on peanut-laden flights? It sounds dramatic, but it's not melodramatic. The only thing that's melodramatic is the reaction of some people who act as giving up a snack is an infringement of their rights.","Thank you for sharing your personal experience as an adult with a peanut allergy.

She is one of those few who react from dust, practically.  We made a decision at an early age simply not to fly.  The airlines have no cohesive, consistent policy and this issue is not something we can show up and be surprised about.

It would help children, and adults, like my daughter if the DOT banned peanuts on all flights.  Of course, asking airlines to stop serving peanuts is not enough.  The DOT would need to require that no passenger bring them aboard as well.  Let's face it, cuts to the airlines have put food at the bottom of their priority list (hence handing out ""snacks"" like peanuts).  So...if you will be flying for hours and have little prospect for food, what is the perfect protein packed food you can bring that needs no refrigeration?

I almost feel like banning peanuts would give people a false sense of security UNLESS a complete and total ban was instituted (airline & passengers).

That being said, I appreciate the argument about other allergies, as well as perfume (though I do not believe anaphylaxis is generally an issue for those allergic to perfume).  Why do we need food on board at all?  Perhaps that is a bit naive and narrow-minded, but how about a drinks-only rule?  Do 1 or 2 hours flights really need to serve ANY kind of food?  Propose that to the airlines as a cost saving measure!  (Of course, longer flights or international is a whole other ballgame.)

So, to answer the DOT questions over there <---- I would say:

1.  From empirical evidence, I believe there is a strong likelihood of a peanut allergy sufferer having a severe reaction if the conditions were right.  My daughter developed hives from peanut shell residue that had touched a banana peel.  She touched the peel to her skin and broke out in hives.  It doesn't take much.

2.  I feel strongly that people should take responsibility for themselves and, therefore, would expect all allergy sufferers to carry their own epinephrine.  However, I am under the assumption that a plane would have first aid available and possibly a defibrillator.  Adding epinephrine to this kit would only be a good business practice.

3.  I would feel (relatively) safe on a plane where peanut-ingredient products are banned from airline and passengers, but ""may contains"" were permitted.  My allergic daughter would not consume them, but the chance of her having a reaction from cross contact or inhalation are virtually nil.  Again, it's about personal responsibility.  We will take care of her food.  We just need help keeping her alive and safe from other peoples food.

The airlines have no cohesive, consistent policy and this issue is not something we can show up and be surprised about.

It would help children, and adults, like my daughter if the DOT banned peanuts on all flights.  Of course, asking airlines to stop serving peanuts is not enough.  The DOT would need to require that no passenger bring them aboard as well.  Let's face it, cuts to the airlines have put food at the bottom of their priority list (hence handing out ""snacks"" like peanuts).  So...if you will be flying for hours and have little prospect for food, what is the perfect protein packed food you can bring that needs no refrigeration?

I almost feel like banning peanuts would give people a false sense of security UNLESS a complete and total ban was instituted (airline & passengers).

That being said, I appreciate the argument about other allergies, as well as perfume (though I do not believe anaphylaxis is generally an issue for those allergic to perfume).  Why do we need food on board at all?  Perhaps that is a bit naive and narrow-minded, but how about a drinks-only rule?  Do 1 or 2 hours flights really need to serve ANY kind of food?  Propose that to the airlines as a cost saving measure!  (Of course, longer flights or international is a whole other ballgame.)

So, to answer the DOT questions over there <---- I would say:

1.  From empirical evidence, I believe there is a strong likelihood of a peanut allergy sufferer having a severe reaction if the conditions were right.  My daughter developed hives from peanut shell residue that had touched a banana peel.  She touched the peel to her skin and broke out in hives.  It doesn't take much.

2.  I feel strongly that people should take responsibility for themselves and, therefore, would expect all allergy sufferers to carry their own epinephrine.  However, I am under the assumption that a plane would have first aid available and possibly a defibrillator.  Adding epinephrine to this kit would only be a good business practice.

3.  I would feel (relatively) safe on a plane where peanut-ingredient products are banned from airline and passengers, but ""may contains"" were permitted.  My allergic daughter would not consume them, but the chance of her having a reaction from cross contact or inhalation are virtually nil.  Again, it's about personal responsibility.  We will take care of her food.  We just need help keeping her alive and safe from other peoples food.

","Thanks you for sharing your story and this information.  If a total ban (airline and passenger) weren't possible, what would the ideal policy you'd support as far as the airlines conduct is concerned?"

Should DOT require that carriers give priority kiosk access to travelers with disabilities? DOT worries that if travelers without disabilities can use accessible (as well as nonaccessible) kiosks, travelers with disabilities may wait longer than average because they need one of a limited number of machines. But reserving accessible kiosks for travelers with disabilities, or giving them priority access, could segregate and stigmatize them.  What is the best resolution of this dilemma?

My response:

The best resolution would be to roll out accessible kiosks in the lines reserved for priority/elite/premium class passengers.  This would best reduce disabled users' wait times (since airlines work to make these lines short), are in a location identifiable in another way, and will ensure that disabled priority/elite/premium class passengers have access to accessible kiosks.  While this will stigmatize some disabled passengers, it seems the best interim solution until the goal of 100% accessibility is achieved.

","Thank you for sharing your thoughtful solution to this dilemma! It's interesting that you propose reserving accessible kiosks for priority/elite/premium class passengers. Can you elaborate on how this approach would ensure that disabled passengers in these classes have access to accessible kiosks, and how it would reduce wait times?"

Now that my son is older and interested in traveling to Europe, we can't reasonably get there via motorhome.  We choose our airlines carefully, carry multiple Epi-pens, pack his food from home, and I pray.

My son tries to sleep most of the flight and fortunately has a much larger bladder than I do.  He gets a window seat and one of us acts as his buffer to the food cart.
This is a scary and risky proposition with a 23 year old who can quickly determine his own symptoms. It would be even scarier with a young child.
The problem with peanuts and tree nuts is that they are dry and flaky so can readily become airborne.  Their oils are sticky and stubborn so can endure through a vigorous scrub with soap and water.
My son is also allergic to milk and eggs. Nobody talks about banning them because they don't have the above mentioned properties of peanuts and tree nuts.

Everyone can live without peanuts and tree nuts.  So let's be reasonable and let all safely travel.  Ban the nuts and see how many more families get onboard.  Airline revenues will probably go up and that's a good thing.

Back to the question of your rights or mine.  I prefer to live in an educated, enlightened, fulfilled, and respectful society.
If my donut is going to set off your diabetes, I will gladly forgo the donut for six to twelve to twenty four hours.  I can live without it.
Everyone can live without peanuts and tree nuts.  So let's be reasonable and let all safely travel.  Ban the nuts and see how many more families get onboard.  Airline revenues will probably go up and that's a good thing.
BTW, I've been in 6 countries in the last 6 months, so I consider myself a frequent flyer.

It is true that the quality of delay information is not always within the airline's control. Often, when the FAA institutes the practice of ""metering"" due to weather or high volume, the airline really can't advise the customers of the reason for a delay. In fact, in order to retain the right to take off, the airlines are required to load the plane and sit on the tarmac while the FAA figures out how to route traffic.

Furthermore, having listened to ground control/tower communications on United flights, it's clear that the controllers can give an estimated delay, but that delay is subject to change. Again, the airline's information is only as good as the FAA's information - and, well, the situation is fluid.

To that end, DOT's rule must consider that FAA's traffic management practices and procedures might necessarily inhibit airlines' ability to comply with such regulations.","Thank you for your comment.

CMV [EDIT] To clarify my argument more, whenever I say art, I mean to say, specifically, music.","Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this topic. I understand that you have strong opinions about the artist's music. Can you elaborate on what specifically makes you think the second video is not music? Is it the lack of melody, rhythm, or something else? Your input will help us better understand your perspective."

Between the security (no liquids, etc.) and the baggage fees pretty soon you won't be able to take anything with you at all. The cost of the ticket is already ridiculously high. Instead of charging us, perhaps they need to bring in consultants and auditors to see just where their money is going (into executive's pockets) and see how they can be more efficient with the money they are already extorting.

I've actually found it's now cheaper to ship my items Fed Ex than it is to bring them with me on the plane. AND they get there! On time!

I totally agree if the airline loses the luggage or it's delayed they should have to refund the fee they charged. They did not provide the service you paid for, end of story.

I completely agree ALL the fees should be listed when you buy that ticket. Prominently. You should know what you are going to be asked to pay for.

I have to say personally that if they start charging me a fee for putting a small bag in the overhead bin I will no longer be a customer. I will not fly any airline that does something so ridiculous. I do all the work AND I have to pay them? No, that's where I draw the line. I'll drive thanks.","

a) Early boarding for passengers with allergies to inspect their assigned seats and either clean them or request a seat change if necessary (Southwest allows early boarding as long as you do not take an exit row)
2) Following declaration of an allergy, education of nearby passengers regarding peanut products (particularly those which may release dust that can go airborne); this could be done with a single-sided piece of paper.

1. The ""one study"" that FMCSA is using to say that there is a 55% non compliance rate is not an accurate number.  We all know that if we look long enough we can find ONE study to say what ever we want.  I drive and have a small compay.  My motto is if you can not do it legal do not do it.  I know there are a very few who do not run legal but I can assure you there will be those when you have EOBRs.  Contrary to those who don't know better these devises are not fool proof they depend on driver input and there can be mistakes. I just talked to a Ms. DOT officer who told me that a large carrier who allows 6 mo. old drivers to become trainers often come in with their EOBR logs that are all messed up, ie both drivers on duty, wrong driver on duty ect. So I dont believe EOBRs will solve this problem.  That being said I do not believe that all companies should have to spend the money to buy and install these devises in their trucks.  I do agree that companies who can not operate in a safe manner should be forced to install these devises and but more importantly should be followed up with vigorously to insure compliance both in the back office and on the road.
2.  How about intergrating the federal system with all the state systems so when one of these carriers comes up to a scale they are flagged a checked on a more stringent basis.  Also make sure that they can not operate a prepass, this way they have to come thru the scales, these companies could also be checked at roadside inspections more often.
3.  It is a sad day when all these special interest groups lobby to pass regulations on an industy that has shown consistant improvment in safety when such regulations are often burdensom  and do not really solve the real problem.","Your comment about FMCSA's safety estimates is very important.  What would you estimate the actual compliance rate to be?  It'd be really helpful if you have a source for your information, like a news article or a report.

I work with these people every day in the capacity of a safety consultant.  They do not need any more items that will cost them money or confuse them.
I have also seen the results from these items and they are confusing, and hard to audit. The system can be easily fooled and will just cause more problems than good.  ",Thank you for sharing your concerns about the potential impact of Electronic On-Board Recorders (EOBRs) on the trucking industry. You've raised some thought-provoking points about the upfront and continual costs of implementing EOBRs. Can you elaborate on what you mean by 'the current system is working so well'? What specific aspects of the current system do you think are effective in promoting safety and product delivery?

How about this. When I work 5 hours BEFORE I start driving because that is what is necessary to keep my job and then I drive 10 or 11 hours following, how will law enforcement know I worked that 5 hours before I started driving.

When are you rocket scientist's going to figure out that you can't make a 24 hour surveillance device that can track what a trucker does.
The problem is not with the drivers, it is with the company's that demand a driver put in unreasonable amounts of hours to keep their job or business.
Make the companies PAY THE DRIVERS FOR DELAYS THE COMPANY'S CAUSE.

Why don't you come up with a mandatory 24/7 personal camera/recording/GPS device that costs each DRIVER $1,000,000.00 and monitor every second of his life. George Orwell would be proud of that. Or better yet, thinking like Obama on job creation. If you hired a personal cop to be assigned to every truck driver 24/7, think of how many great jobs that would create. I think that alone would end our recession. That would create so many jobs that you could eliminate the unemployment bureaus all around the country and all of the unemployment payments.

So much so, that it is strictly avoided.  It is not worth risking my child's life to fly on an airplane.  A recent study reveals that 1 in 3 airplane reactions was anaphylaxis (Allergic Living Magazine).  I don't like those odds.  The substitution of cashews, walnuts, or other tree nuts is not a viable option, as they pose the same risks as peanuts.  A large number of people who are allergic to peanuts are also allergic to tree nuts, plus they are typically processed in a plant that also processes peanuts.  If there were a ban on peanut and tree nut products on flights, it would open the world to my son.  He didn't choose to be allergic, but he is.  I like the comment about not knowing anyone who would die if they DIDN'T have a peanut.  So true.  We are not talking about sensitivity, being offended, not liking the smell, etc.; we are talking about life.  There are a lot of things that are banned from airplanes that can cause death to someone.  In the case of my son, a peanut can have the same result.  I urge the DOT to issue the ban, and make traveling safe for everyone.","Thanks for sharing your experiences, AllergyDad.

Passengers may lack check cashing privileges away from their home airport, yet face unplanned and likely elevated expenses after being ""bumped.""   They should have a mandatory option of cash payment.  An credit card credit, if immediate, would be more secure and as useful to more passengers than either a check or cash.

The proposed compensation limits are too low to provide an incentive to the airlines to limit overbooking and may be arbitrarily unfair to certain travelers.

I don't think I can figure that out given the four area's I'm allowed to record and if it is automatically recorded for me, how will law enforcement distinguish it as being any of the four categories?
How about this. When I work 5 hours BEFORE I start driving because that is what is necessary to keep my job and then I drive 10 or 11 hours following, how will law enforcement know I worked that 5 hours before I started driving. Or, when I get done driving, I work another 5 hours making my day a 20 hour day. As long as I don't enter that into the EOBR, it will appear to law enforcement that I only worked 10 or 11 hours that day. Slick!!! Now my boss can make me work 20 hours a day and only 10 or 11 hours will show on the EOBR. Just what I needed.
When are you rocket scientist's going to figure out that you can't make a 24 hour surveillance device that can track what a trucker does.
The problem is not with the drivers, it is with the company's that demand a driver put in unreasonable amounts of hours to keep their job or business.
Make the companies PAY THE DRIVERS FOR DELAYS THE COMPANY'S CAUSE. Do that one little thing, and you will find most every driver will quit trying to ""catch up"" for all the delays that have been forced on them without pay and gladly only put in a 10 or 11 hour day. But I suppose that is way to common sense for all you ""never even had your ass in a truck seat"" bureaucrats up there in Washington to comprehend.
Why don't you come up with a mandatory 24/7 personal camera/recording/GPS device that costs each DRIVER $1,000,000.00 and monitor every second of his life. George Orwell would be proud of that. Or better yet, thinking like Obama on job creation. If you hired a personal cop to be assigned to every truck driver 24/7, think of how many great jobs that would create. I think that alone would end our recession. That would create so many jobs that you could eliminate the unemployment bureaus all around the country and all of the unemployment payments. That would save a ton of money and probably bail us out of this recession.

I don't think I can figure that out given the four area's I'm allowed to record and if it is automatically recorded for me, how will law enforcement distinguish it as being any of the four categories?
How about this. When I work 5 hours BEFORE I start driving because that is what is necessary to keep my job and then I drive 10 or 11 hours following, how will law enforcement know I worked that 5 hours before I started driving. Or, when I get done driving, I work another 5 hours making my day a 20 hour day. As long as I don't enter that into the EOBR, it will appear to law enforcement that I only worked 10 or 11 hours that day. Slick!!! Now my boss can make me work 20 hours a day and only 10 or 11 hours will show on the EOBR. Just what I needed.
When are you rocket scientist's going to figure out that you can't make a 24 hour surveillance device that can track what a trucker does.
The problem is not with the drivers, it is with the company's that demand a driver put in unreasonable amounts of hours to keep their job or business.
Make the companies PAY THE DRIVERS FOR DELAYS THE COMPANY'S CAUSE. Do that one little thing, and you will find most every driver will quit trying to ""catch up"" for all the delays that have been forced on them without pay and gladly only put in a 10 or 11 hour day. But I suppose that is way to common sense for all you ""never even had your ass in a truck seat"" bureaucrats up there in Washington to comprehend.
Why don't you come up with a mandatory 24/7 personal camera/recording/GPS device that costs each DRIVER $1,000,000.00 and monitor every second of his life. George Orwell would be proud of that. Or better yet, thinking like Obama on job creation. If you hired a personal cop to be assigned to every truck driver 24/7, think of how many great jobs that would create. I think that alone would end our recession. That would create so many jobs that you could eliminate the unemployment bureaus all around the country and all of the unemployment payments. That would save a ton of money and probably bail us out of this recession.

Instead, if a greater emphasis (in some way shape or form) was placed on the sciences and engineering, and if we simply had more manpower to work on things such as effective desalination of water, solar/wind power, nuclear fusion, etc they would become better understood, more practiced, and become the norm for such procedures in the future, setting our world back on track to a sustainable future. The fact of the matter is that the world right now does not need millions of art students or literature majors, the world needs nuclear physicists and chemists to spur on development, to keep the earth safe and healthy for sustainable growth. It is **then** that we can encourage a greater freedom of studies, and have people analyzing mill on the floss etc. TLDR; art, english, humanity degrees should all do some science so we can figure out fusion and stuff _____","Thank you for sharing your concerns about the impact of our current educational system on the environment.

The issue with other words has less to do with etymology and more to do with the fact that 'idiot' and 'moron' were once actual diagnosis used in medicine. As far as I know, 'silly', 'absurd','fool', etc. were not. Since 'retarded' is now obsolete as well, shouldn't all outdated words for developmental issues be treated the same?",Thank you for sharing your insight!

From reading some of the post I understand that the argument has been made that peanuts should be banned because people can die of a peanut allergy.  I also believe that animals should also be banned then because people who are allergic and or have asthma could also die if they are on an extended flight with an animal they are allergic to.

Kas, where do you fall on the peanut issue? Do you think that it should be banned or only banned if animals are banned? Or something else?

All OPTIONAL fees should be listed separately. These should be listed prominently on a travel web site, airline web site, ticket counter, and on the boarding pass. I can't remember how many times I've lost my receipt for baggage fees when trying to be reimbursed by my company for business travel, and to have to root through my wallet or purse for a tiny slip of paper is ridiculous.

Make all signs standard for each airline: you don't need to figure out where each menu item is listed at McDonald's -- they're all the same to make ordering easier for the customer.

Plain English (and maybe Spanish), written at a fifth grade level. Short and simple: Bag #1 - $15; Bag #2 - $25; Any bag over 50 lbs: $100 (for example).

I wouldn't reduce my carry-ons if checked baggage were free because I never put my lap-top computer in a checked bag. I carry an overnight bag just in case my checked luggage goes missing (and it has -- many times). But a good suggestion about airlines ENFORCING their carry-on bag limits (size and number) would go a long way to reducing traveler frustration.

I also think anyone carrying their belongings in a plastic grocery bag should be stopped at the gate and forced to buy a more sturdy woven bag for a nominal fee.","Thank you for sharing your thoughts on airline passenger rights!

I was in favor of this before my 3 year old was diagnosed with a peanut allergy (because I knew how serious reactions could be) and I certainly remain in favor now. Food allergies are becoming more and more common (and you can get food allergies at any point in your life so people should not think that this ""only concerns someone else or someone else's kid"" because it could very well concern YOU and your family at some point)...People do not need peanuts to survive but those who are allergic DO need a peanut free area to survive. If no one cares about anyone but themselves, at least realize that if peanuts are served on a flight and someone has a reaction, your plane will have to make an emergency landing. That's not something that anyone wants. Is the desire to have peanuts really worth the risk of an emergency landing?

I think it is a sad statement on our society that this even is a debatable issue.

I would support a complete ban of peanuts and peanut products on aircraft carriers, as they are a confined, temporary space with no access to emergency medical assistance. Airplanes are different than airports, restaurants, taxis and other places that people have mentioned where a ban would not be necessary.

In the future, I would also support a ban of ANY SUBSTANCE proven to cause death ... peanuts are not the only food. Tree nuts and shellfish can be just as deadly. And if it was proven that perfume, body odor or bad breath (as some of the other commentators compared this issue to) was shown to cause death, then yes, those should be banned as well.

It will not kill anyone to NOT EAT peanuts during the course of one flight. I WILL KILL someone with food allergies if they accidentally do.","Thank you for your comments.  Do you have suggestions on how airlines could enforce the ban on the plane if peanuts are still sold in airports?

Also, you should check out the discussion on tarmac delays and how proposals of debarking the plane when there are delays may impact an airlines ability to implement a ban on peanuts on board.  What do you think?"

As someone that once logged 100+ flights per year for many years, I have experienced both the best and the worst of what air travel can provide.

I would like to offer some insights that hopefully will expand the scope of the regulation you are considering vis-à-vis airline-passenger communication.  From a passenger perspective, I believe there are actually three deficiencies that drive the current communication problem, and resulting shortcomings in the system:  (1) There is a major disconnect in information between gate agents and reservation agents; (2) There is no prompt communication between the airline and the passenger (as you correctly note here); and (3) There is no way to guarantee re-booking or re-routing, without penalty, without going to the airport.  As a result, even when there is a high likelihood that a flight will be canceled, passengers go to the airport, often at significant expense, then must wait in long lines, causing havoc inside the airport, and creating the inefficient system that we are all familiar with.  I believe these three together are the source of the problem and would like to illustrate this with a brief example:

This winter, I had a vacation booked to Colorado to ski.  On the day of travel there was heavy snow in New York City.  To me it was obvious that my flight would be canceled.  However, despite repeated calls to the airline, I was assured that the flight was showing to depart on-time (Problems 1 and 2).  However, knowing that if the flight did leave, even if that were 5 hours later, I would face a steep re-booking expense (change fee plus fare difference!), I went to the airport regardless (Problem 3).  Upon arrival at the airport, and after checking my skis curbside, my fears were of course confirmed, the flight had been canceled, and there were long lines at all of the agent counters and the gates.  I then waited in line for an hour, re-booked, waited another hour to collect my bag, and returned home.  The monetary expense for me was $150 in cab rides and tips, and 5 hours in time, and one day of lost skiing.  None of which was claimable/reimbursable.

So, I would like to suggest oversight/regulation of the following:  (1) Airlines should be required to invest in systems that streamline information so that information among their reservations agents is as current as it is at the gate; (2) In addition to notifying passengers about their flight promptly (30 minutes sounds reasonable), there should be earlier, and more frequent communication about overall ""Airport Health"" on the day of travel.  For example, just letting a passenger know about his/her flight in advance does not necessarily help at all.  If that communication comes less than 90 minutes before departure, it is outside of the window in which a passenger can react:  he/she is already on the way to the airport.  However, if an earlier communication were:  ""Due to heavy snow, all flights this morning have been departing 1-2 hours behind schedule.  Please prepare for delays/possibility of cancellation.  We will provide another status update in one hour.""  This is a communication that a passenger can thoughtfully incorporate into his/her planning.  Finally, (3) Rules should be developed defining the conditions under which a passenger can rebook without charge.  Perhaps if the flight is going to be delayed more than 3 hours, it is better for the passenger and the airline to let a passenger rebook.  Sometimes the flight is overbooked anyway.

I believe further consideration of the above collectively would result in a far better passenger experience, and more efficient airline management.  Thank you for considering my input.

There is absolutely no need for other passengers to have peanuts with a total disregard for the safety (and life) of a fellow passenger.

A similar problem, that should also be addressed, along with the peanut allergy problem, is the case of allowing small domestic pets in the cabin of a aircraft.  People with allergic sensitivity to dog and cat dander are in danger of dying from an acute asthma attack.  These animals are being stored under the seat in front of the pet owner which may be directly under an asthmatic passenger.  Additionally, many pet owners do not keep these animals in their carriers for the entire flight which increases the chance of exposure. Even when there are no animals on a particular flight, their presence on previous flights (and the lack of thorough cleaning) means that their dander is still present and a hazard to asthma sufferers.  Service animals are often allowed on the seats of many flights by the cabin crews which can be deadly to an asthmatic occupying that seat on a subsequent flight.","

A similar problem, that should also be addressed, along with the peanut allergy problem, is the case of allowing small domestic pets in the cabin of a aircraft.  People with allergic sensitivity to dog and cat dander are in danger of dying from an acute asthma attack.  These animals are being stored under the seat in front of the pet owner which may be directly under an asthmatic passenger.  Additionally, many pet owners do not keep these animals in their carriers for the entire flight which increases the chance of exposure. Even when there are no animals on a particular flight, their presence on previous flights (and the lack of thorough cleaning) means that their dander is still present and a hazard to asthma sufferers.  Service animals are often allowed on the seats of many flights by the cabin crews which can be deadly to an asthmatic occupying that seat on a subsequent flight.","

There are already so many things a driver is responsible for without adding anything else.  The EOBR would just be one more thing they would have to keep up with.  A paper log is easy you just mark it when you stop and again when you leave.  No electronics involved in doing that. I do not see how the EOBR will improve safety either.  If a driver does not break the rules and sticks to the HOS then there will be no safety issues because he or she will have done what they are supposed to without the EORB.  I have read articles about the EORB and from what I have read the input in them is not always accurate.  If the driver can modify information that goes into the EORB what good will they be.

Also, when they are stopped at the gate with an oversized ""carry-on"" they should be charged a fee to check it if the rest of us have paid a baggage check fee.

""Significant fees"" should be defined as those charged for something that is an essential part of the flight, i.e. seating, baggage, fuel, and I guess some airlines are considering charging for the use of overhead space and bathrooms.

In response to what DOT wants to know:

1) I know that there are individuals who are more sensitive to peanut dust than I am. If it is at all likely that a single customer can suffer a  life-threatening reaction on an airplane, I believe peanuts should not be served because of that person.
I cannot understand why all airlines do not voluntarily stop serving peanuts. Will it actually take someone dying mid-flight, (and the inevitable law suit,) to change peoples' minds?
2) I believe that the risk posed by peanuts to a small percentage of the population warrants them not being served on airplanes. Air travel is a necessary part of modern living and cannot be avoided by those with allergies. I do not believe that airlines need - or should - carry epipens. The people best trained to use them are those with the allergy and presumably will have their own if the risk demands.
3) I cannot fathom why airlines would go through the trouble of carrying epipens (and training flight attendants to use them) just so they can continue to serve peanuts. What is so bad about pretzels after all? It seems as if some people believe that peanuts are the only thing that can be served on an airplane.
4) I do not believe that foods which would release peanut dust into the air should be served. In my mind this includes packages of peanuts and peanut butter crackers.

   The airlines should not be banning any food and they certainly should not be come the food police.

  Some facts to consider.  studies show that you cannot have a serious/deadly reaction to peanut, tree nut,  or other food allergy protein by smelling it; despite what some of the contributors here have said.  Less than 1% of the population has a peanut allergy and not all of those are ""severly"" allergic. (Compare that with the exponentially higher incidence of diabetes--diabetics need plant based proteins like peanuts during flights to keep their blood sugar levels under control.) or, a milk allergy which is far more prevelent.
  Airborne exposure will not affect the body systemically, so therefore cannot cause anaphylaxis. If extremely allergic, you may have some symptoms like sneezing, running nose and coughing. For those peanut or tree nut allergic, and for all food allergies, you MUST ingest the food protein to have a systemtic reaction. And, even with direct skin contact to tree nuts, peanuts or peanut and nut butters, most allergic people will not show signs of a reaction, or it so it will be a localized minor one such as hives, or a welt.
   You can, however, have a psyhcosomatic reaction to anything you are afraid of.  Peanut allergy has become an exaggerated fear to the detriment of those who suffer from other food allergies and other serious and chronic diseases.
   A few Facts:  more than 3,000 kids die from asthma each year; 10,000 kids go to the hospital each year with brain injuries due to sports; 45,000 kids die in car accidents. Last time i saw a statisic on food allergy fatalities it was aobut 100 to 150 over a five year period for all foods.  This is not to say that peanut and tree nut allergies, or any allergy is not serious. They are.
  But I wonder if these same parents who are demandting that peanuts and tree nuts be banned from everywhere are asking for sports be eliminated from school programs, or if their children are being kept out of sports. or, have they given up driving their children in a car; or, will they get their son or daughter a drivers license at age 16.
  i have a friend whose child almost died twice from a serious allergy to milk because people think milk allergy can't be fatal; they confuse milk allergy with lactose intolerance because the hysteria created by some about peanut has drowned out any sense of reason and overshadowed everyone else's issues.  A recent widely publicized study showed that far more people think they have food allergies than actually do. Again, i am not minimizing those who do, but a food allergy needs to be diagnosed by a certified immunologist who conducts a food challenge. Then and only then does a patient really know what they are allergic to. and, a food allergy is very different than a food sensitivity.   Many people have multiple food allergies, but once properly diagnosed that person needs to be taught to care for themselves and take all necessary precautions.
   Also, I read in the news is that patients with egg and food allergy have now been de-sensitized in clinical settings with guess what?  egg and peanut!  so, let's rid ourselves of the hysteria.  let's stop our demanding and outrageousness and let's call for ome common sense.  i fear for these children that are being raised by parents to live in fear of the ""bogey man"".  instead of teaching them to handle whatever afflication they have in a responsible and calm manner--whether it's severe asthma, other food allergies, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and the hundreds of other afflications that so many of us live with everyday.
   I myself have a food allergy so i truly understand what it takes to be vigliant; it isn't easy.
   in all my years of flying and with all the different carriers i have been on, i find that whether in the US or abroad, without legislation, they try to be as accommodating as possible when people plan ahead and are not behaving rudely.
   we have more than enough regulation and every time a new regulation comes along it always carries unintended consequences.  so, once you ban peanuts and tree nuts, will you prohibit seeing eye dogs on flights for those of us who are severly allergic?  Remember, you can die from an asthma attack caused by a reaction to an animal. or, will you have a voice of reason and talk with the carrier, check on your medications, where a highly refined mask and take the right precautions.
   My own near fatal experience to a different allergy reinforced for me that if you demand the world conform to you, you will become lax making it more likely you will have an accidenta encounter.  we need to be prepared and proactive, not create a bubble around ourselves and our children.

I fly extensively in the US and internationally.  And, in reading all the comments posted thus far, for the most part, there appears to be a lot of emotion and not a lot of facts surrounding this issue.
   The airlines should not be banning any food and they certainly should not be come the food police.
  I strongly urge the DOT to get more scientic-based information.  Any disability needs to be treated with sensitivity. However, i want to point out that when we installed ramps for those in a wheel chairs, we did not remove the stairs.
  Some facts to consider.  studies show that you cannot have a serious/deadly reaction to peanut, tree nut,  or other food allergy protein by smelling it; despite what some of the contributors here have said.  Less than 1% of the population has a peanut allergy and not all of those are ""severly"" allergic. (Compare that with the exponentially higher incidence of diabetes--diabetics need plant based proteins like peanuts during flights to keep their blood sugar levels under control.) or, a milk allergy which is far more prevelent.
  Airborne exposure will not affect the body systemically, so therefore cannot cause anaphylaxis. If extremely allergic, you may have some symptoms like sneezing, running nose and coughing. For those peanut or tree nut allergic, and for all food allergies, you MUST ingest the food protein to have a systemtic reaction. And, even with direct skin contact to tree nuts, peanuts or peanut and nut butters, most allergic people will not show signs of a reaction, or it so it will be a localized minor one such as hives, or a welt.
   You can, however, have a psyhcosomatic reaction to anything you are afraid of.  Peanut allergy has become an exaggerated fear to the detriment of those who suffer from other food allergies and other serious and chronic diseases.
   A few Facts:  more than 3,000 kids die from asthma each year; 10,000 kids go to the hospital each year with brain injuries due to sports; 45,000 kids die in car accidents. Last time i saw a statisic on food allergy fatalities it was aobut 100 to 150 over a five year period for all foods.  This is not to say that peanut and tree nut allergies, or any allergy is not serious. They are.
  But I wonder if these same parents who are demandting that peanuts and tree nuts be banned from everywhere are asking for sports be eliminated from school programs, or if their children are being kept out of sports. or, have they given up driving their children in a car; or, will they get their son or daughter a drivers license at age 16.
  i have a friend whose child almost died twice from a serious allergy to milk because people think milk allergy can't be fatal; they confuse milk allergy with lactose intolerance because the hysteria created by some about peanut has drowned out any sense of reason and overshadowed everyone else's issues.  A recent widely publicized study showed that far more people think they have food allergies than actually do. Again, i am not minimizing those who do, but a food allergy needs to be diagnosed by a certified immunologist who conducts a food challenge. Then and only then does a patient really know what they are allergic to. and, a food allergy is very different than a food sensitivity.   Many people have multiple food allergies, but once properly diagnosed that person needs to be taught to care for themselves and take all necessary precautions.
   Also, I read in the news is that patients with egg and food allergy have now been de-sensitized in clinical settings with guess what?  egg and peanut!  so, let's rid ourselves of the hysteria.  let's stop our demanding and outrageousness and let's call for ome common sense.  i fear for these children that are being raised by parents to live in fear of the ""bogey man"".  instead of teaching them to handle whatever afflication they have in a responsible and calm manner--whether it's severe asthma, other food allergies, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and the hundreds of other afflications that so many of us live with everyday.
   I myself have a food allergy so i truly understand what it takes to be vigliant; it isn't easy.
   in all my years of flying and with all the different carriers i have been on, i find that whether in the US or abroad, without legislation, they try to be as accommodating as possible when people plan ahead and are not behaving rudely.

As someone that once logged 100+ flights per year for many years, I have experienced both the best and the worst of what air travel can provide.

I would like to offer some insights that hopefully will expand the scope of the regulation you are considering vis-à-vis airline-passenger communication.  From a passenger perspective, I believe there are actually three deficiencies that drive the current communication problem, and resulting shortcomings in the system:  (1) There is a major disconnect in information between gate agents and reservation agents; (2) There is no prompt communication between the airline and the passenger (as you correctly note here); and (3) There is no way to guarantee re-booking or re-routing, without penalty, without going to the airport.  As a result, even when there is a high likelihood that a flight will be canceled, passengers go to the airport, often at significant expense, then must wait in long lines, causing havoc inside the airport, and creating the inefficient system that we are all familiar with.  I believe these three together are the source of the problem and would like to illustrate this with a brief example:

This winter, I had a vacation booked to Colorado to ski.  On the day of travel there was heavy snow in New York City.  To me it was obvious that my flight would be canceled.  However, despite repeated calls to the airline, I was assured that the flight was showing to depart on-time (Problems 1 and 2).  However, knowing that if the flight did leave, even if that were 5 hours later, I would face a steep re-booking expense (change fee plus fare difference!), I went to the airport regardless (Problem 3).  Upon arrival at the airport, and after checking my skis curbside, my fears were of course confirmed, the flight had been canceled, and there were long lines at all of the agent counters and the gates.  I then waited in line for an hour, re-booked, waited another hour to collect my bag, and returned home.  The monetary expense for me was $150 in cab rides and tips, and 5 hours in time, and one day of lost skiing.  None of which was claimable/reimbursable.

So, I would like to suggest oversight/regulation of the following:  (1) Airlines should be required to invest in systems that streamline information so that information among their reservations agents is as current as it is at the gate; (2) In addition to notifying passengers about their flight promptly (30 minutes sounds reasonable), there should be earlier, and more frequent communication about overall ""Airport Health"" on the day of travel.  For example, just letting a passenger know about his/her flight in advance does not necessarily help at all.  If that communication comes less than 90 minutes before departure, it is outside of the window in which a passenger can react:  he/she is already on the way to the airport.  However, if an earlier communication were:  ""Due to heavy snow, all flights this morning have been departing 1-2 hours behind schedule.  Please prepare for delays/possibility of cancellation.  We will provide another status update in one hour.""  This is a communication that a passenger can thoughtfully incorporate into his/her planning.  Finally, (3) Rules should be developed defining the conditions under which a passenger can rebook without charge.  Perhaps if the flight is going to be delayed more than 3 hours, it is better for the passenger and the airline to let a passenger rebook.  Sometimes the flight is overbooked anyway.

I believe further consideration of the above collectively would result in a far better passenger experience, and more efficient airline management.  Thank you for considering my input.

Firstly, I have traveled relatively frequently out of the USA. What I find very interesting is that on the various airlines I have used, none have applied the Baggage Charge on my return flights from the other countries back to the USA. Why is this so?
It leaves me to believe that either the other countries airline offices are operating on their own and more efficiently and therefore find it unnecessary to charge for baggage or that there is something definitely Not Transparent.
Furthermore, it is my opinion that if there is a ""Charge"" for something, in this case baggage, that it is a contract and that the baggage if not delivered with the owner and the time of arrival, then the contract has been broken and a refund is due the customer.

I would like to thank the DOT for having the courage to bring this matter up and to ask for comments from the public, especially after being told by Congress in 1998 to drop the matter or risk having funding removed. No doubt the peanut lobby played a major part in that directive.

Those who have legitimate life threatening allergies (and there are many) have a right to be heard. Unfortunately, there appear to be many who wish to snuff out these voices because certain rights may be impeded.

 Congress should listen to the doctors and scientists who study these disabilities and allow the experts to make their honest recommendations. I understand that the peanut lobby will probably want their say, but money should not outweigh logic and science.

I would prefer a total ban on peanut and tree nut foods being served on flights.

My granddaughter has been medically diagnosed as having several allergies, including these two items. We are not hysterical, and we would be much happier if these allergies could disappear or be cured. Unfortunately, the science is not there yet. So, the family must all read labels, call companies when the labels are not clear, talk with restaurants, take ""safe"" food with us when no other solution is possible, and always carry a bag with any possibly required medications. We accept these as our responsibility.

We are restricted from being able to take family vacations very far from home because of the negative attitudes of the airline companies, or lack of choices because of living next to a Delta hub. This does not affect one person, this affects 12! I would have thought that the airlines would have taken this into account when looking at their bottom dollar, but Delta has stated that they will not restrict peanuts because their home is in Georgia!

I would like to thank the DOT for having the courage to bring this matter up and to ask for comments from the public, especially after being told by Congress in 1998 to drop the matter or risk having funding removed. No doubt the peanut lobby played a major part in that directive.

Those who have legitimate life threatening allergies (and there are many) have a right to be heard. Unfortunately, there appear to be many who wish to snuff out these voices because certain rights may be impeded.

 Congress should listen to the doctors and scientists who study these disabilities and allow the experts to make their honest recommendations. I understand that the peanut lobby will probably want their say, but money should not outweigh logic and science.

I would prefer a total ban on peanut and tree nut foods being served on flights.

My granddaughter has been medically diagnosed as having several allergies, including these two items. We are not hysterical, and we would be much happier if these allergies could disappear or be cured. Unfortunately, the science is not there yet. So, the family must all read labels, call companies when the labels are not clear, talk with restaurants, take ""safe"" food with us when no other solution is possible, and always carry a bag with any possibly required medications. We accept these as our responsibility.

We are restricted from being able to take family vacations very far from home because of the negative attitudes of the airline companies, or lack of choices because of living next to a Delta hub. This does not affect one person, this affects 12! I would have thought that the airlines would have taken this into account when looking at their bottom dollar, but Delta has stated that they will not restrict peanuts because their home is in Georgia!

The negative comments from some of the writers posted here are not helpful in defining what is the correct solution to allow allergy sufferers, and their families, to fly.

Get the feedback from the experts, make logical decisions, and fund the research into finding cures or relief for those suffering from the disability of life threatening allergies. All life threatening allergies! But please do not wait until someone dies before acting.","Thank you for the comment smr.

He didn't touch one thing and he sat in his very large car seat the whole time. About 30 min. into the flight, his eyes were swollen shut and his face was bright red... just from breathing (isn't breathing a right we deserve?). I let the flight attendant know but all she said was ""I hope you have your medicine"".  THIS WAS A THREE YEAR OLD! It was really scary. Thankfully, I did have his medicine but I have never flown with him since. It makes me REALLY sad to hear all of your comments about banning other foods, animals, perfumes, etc. (You know that is not the intention.) How insensitive, especially to those of us who have lost a child or a loved one to such a small thing as a PEANUT. No one would EVER wish this upon their child. It is not something we have chosen. It is a dark shadow that we have to live with every day. Would you tell the elderly person who was able to board before you that she/he can't sit in the first row because it's not fair? Personally, I teach my children to love and respect all people, in all circumstances. I would hope others are doing the same.
Can you imagine being given a free trip to Disney World with your child and you just can't go because you can't fly to get there? This is what has happened to us, just this month. It's really sad. I can't even tell my son about it.
So, obviously, I would support the ban of peanuts on planes. I don't even care if someone brings them on board (well, of course, I would not want that) but packaged peanuts are a different story. The oils on your hands are on those fabric seats forever and the peanut POOF is in the ventilation system for everyone to breathe. In regards to medicines, someone mentioned earlier about a defibrillator being on board. They are prepared for heart problems but a child's first reaction to peanuts is just as likely and deadly, so maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to have one. Although, I can't imagine someone with a peanut allergy coming on board without their medicines.
On a side note, someone commented about how this would only effect 1% of the population. I'm not sure about that number. But, I do know that out my family of 5, NONE of us can fly with my child... so not only does my son not fly, but we don't. I would venture to say that this is the same case for most families. So, much more than 1% would be e/affected.
Thanks for letting me give my thoughts. ","
				Thank you for your input and for sharing a personal story of how your family was directly impacted by this issue.  You raise a very interesting point concerning the effects of peanut allergies not just on those that suffer from them, but also the impact they have on families/friends.  The DOT is interested in learning more about how one family member's allergy can impact the travel plans of the entire family.

Yes, you are fortunate.  For some people (my son) the life-threatening reaction of airway constriction is immediate.

Your concern about religious people requesting further bans on food reveals a lot about you. I'll quell your fears with this:  My son is not offended by peanuts nor do I have a book that says he shouldn't eat them; peanuts could kill him.  It is a scientifically proven fact that anaphylaxis exists and can kill after peanut exposure.

It's pretty reliable data.

Let life and death be the standard for what foods to ban, and no one should have a problem with this issue.  I didn't know that there was a sizable peanut lobby, nor that so many Americans tie their rights, freedom, and understanding of Capitalism to their ability to eat peanuts.
