Moderation Guidelines:
- Reply with a comment that is fitting and makes sense as a reply to the user comment.
- Make it clear what actions need to be done.
- Check for any issues in the User Comment and if any, make sure to address them well.
- Remain neutral on the topic and on the Comment Substance and Commenter’s Viewpoint. The reply shouldn’t give away the opinion of the moderator on the topic or comment..
- Use simple, clear, plain language and avoid overwhelming the user e.g. with too many questions.
- show a spirit of inquiry and a desire to learn from and understand commenter’s experience and views. Try to be interested in the bases upon which each commenter stakes his or her claims and the lines of reasoning that has led each commenter to those particular conclusions..
- Avoid biases towards the commenter and avoid stereotypes or prejudices.
- Be welcoming, encouraging and acknowledging. Avoid Evaluative and/or Condescending Responses.
